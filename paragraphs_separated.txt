The
lone
lamp
post
of
the
one-street
town
flickered,
not
quite
dead
but
definitely
on
its
way
out.
Suitcase
by
her
side,
she
paid
no
heed
to
the
light,
the
street
or
the
town.
A
car
was
coming
down
the
street
and
with
her
arm
outstretched
and
thumb
in
the
air,
she
had
a
plan.
Do
you
think
you're
living
an
ordinary
life?
You
are
so
mistaken
it's
difficult
to
even
explain.
The
mere
fact
that
you
exist
makes
you
extraordinary.
The
odds
of
you
existing
are
less
than
winning
the
lottery,
but
here
you
are.
Are
you
going
to
let
this
extraordinary
opportunity
pass?
The
boxed
moved.
That
was
a
problem.
Peter
had
packed
the
box
three
hours
before
and
there
was
nothing
inside
that
should
make
it
move.
The
question
now
was
whether
or
not
Peter
was
going
to
open
it
up
and
look
inside
to
see
why
it
had
moved.
The
answer
to
that
question
was
obvious.
Peter
dropped
the
package
into
the
mailbox
so
he
would
never
have
to
see
it
again.
The
opened
package
of
potato
chips
held
the
answer
to
the
mystery.
Both
detectives
looked
at
it
but
failed
to
realize
it
was
the
key
to
solve
the
crime.
They
passed
by
it
assuming
it
was
random
trash
ensuring
that
the
case
would
never
be
solved.
Sometimes
it's
simply
better
to
ignore
the
haters.
That's
the
lesson
that
Tom's
dad
had
been
trying
to
teach
him,
but
Tom
still
couldn't
let
it
go.
He
latched
onto
them
and
their
hate
and
couldn't
let
it
go,
but
he
also
realized
that
this
wasn't
healthy.
That's
when
he
came
up
with
his
devious
plan.
The
paper
was
blank.
It
shouldn't
have
been.
There
should
have
been
writing
on
the
paper,
at
least
a
paragraph
if
not
more.
The
fact
that
the
writing
wasn't
there
was
frustrating.
Actually,
it
was
even
more
than
frustrating.
It
was
downright
distressing.
Spending
time
at
national
parks
can
be
an
exciting
adventure,
but
this
wasn't
the
type
of
excitement
she
was
hoping
to
experience.
As
she
contemplated
the
situation
she
found
herself
in,
she
knew
she'd
gotten
herself
in
a
little
more
than
she
bargained
for.
It
wasn't
often
that
she
found
herself
in
a
tree
staring
down
at
a
pack
of
wolves
that
were
looking
to
make
her
their
next
meal.
No
matter
how
hard
he
tried,
he
couldn't
give
her
a
good
explanation
about
what
had
happened.
It
didn't
even
really
make
sense
to
him.
All
he
knew
was
that
he
froze
at
the
moment
and
no
matter
how
hard
he
tried
to
react,
nothing
in
his
body
allowed
him
to
move.
It
was
as
if
he
had
instantly
become
a
statue
and
although
he
could
see
what
was
taking
place,
he
couldn't
move
to
intervene.
He
knew
that
wasn't
a
satisfactory
explanation
even
though
it
was
the
truth.
Her
hair
was
a
tangled
mess
which
she
tried
to
make
presentable
by
putting
in
a
lump
on
the
top
of
her
head.
It
didn't
really
work
although
it
was
a
valiant
attempt.
While
most
people
simply
noticed
the
tangled
mess
on
top
of
her
head,
what
most
people
failed
to
understand
that
within
the
tangles
mess
was
an
entirely
new
year.
That
was
her
secret.
She
kept
worlds
on
top
of
her
head.
Finding
the
truth
wouldn't
be
easy,
that's
for
sure.
Then
there
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
Jane
really
wanted
to
know
the
truth.
That's
the
thing
that
bothered
her
most.
It
wasn't
the
difficulty
of
actually
finding
out
what
happened
that
was
the
obstacle,
but
having
to
live
with
that
information
once
it
was
found.
It
had
been
a
simple
realization
that
had
changed
Debra's
life
perspective.
It
was
really
so
simple
that
she
was
embarrassed
that
she
had
lived
the
previous
five
years
with
the
way
she
measured
her
worth.
Now
that
she
saw
what
she
had
been
doing,
she
could
see
how
sad
it
was.
That
made
her
all
the
more
relieved
she
had
made
the
change.
The
number
of
hearts
her
Instagram
posts
received
wasn't
any
longer
the
indication
of
her
own
self-worth.
The
words
hadn't
flowed
from
his
fingers
for
the
past
few
weeks.
He
never
imagined
he'd
find
himself
with
writer's
block,
but
here
he
sat
with
a
blank
screen
in
front
of
him.
That
blank
screen
taunting
him
day
after
day
had
started
to
play
with
his
mind.
He
didn't
understand
why
he
couldn't
even
type
a
single
word,
just
one
to
begin
the
process
and
build
from
there.
And
yet,
he
already
knew
that
the
eight
hours
he
was
prepared
to
sit
in
front
of
his
computer
today
would
end
with
the
screen
remaining
blank.
Hopes
and
dreams
were
dashed
that
day.
It
should
have
been
expected,
but
it
still
came
as
a
shock.
The
warning
signs
had
been
ignored
in
favor
of
the
possibility,
however
remote,
that
it
could
actually
happen.
That
possibility
had
grown
from
hope
to
an
undeniable
belief
it
must
be
destiny.
That
was
until
it
wasn't
and
the
hopes
and
dreams
came
crashing
down.
There
was
a
reason
for
her
shyness.
Everyone
assumed
it
had
always
been
there
but
she
knew
better.
She
knew
the
exact
moment
that
the
shyness
began.
It
had
been
that
fateful
moment
at
the
lake.
There
are
just
some
events
that
do
that
to
you.
He
couldn't
remember
exactly
where
he
had
read
it,
but
he
was
sure
that
he
had.
The
fact
that
she
didn't
believe
him
was
quite
frustrating
as
he
began
to
search
the
Internet
to
find
the
article.
It
wasn't
as
if
it
was
something
that
seemed
impossible.
Yet
she
insisted
on
always
seeing
the
source
whenever
he
stated
a
fact.
Matt
told
her
to
reach
for
the
stars,
but
Veronica
thought
it
was
the
most
ridiculous
advice
she'd
ever
received.
Sure,
it
had
been
well-meaning
when
he
said
it,
but
she
didn't
understand
why
anyone
would
want
to
suggest
something
that
would
literally
kill
you
if
you
actually
managed
to
achieve
it.
Twenty-five
hours
had
passed
since
the
incident.
It
seemed
to
be
a
lot
longer
than
that.
That
twenty-five
hours
seemed
more
like
a
week
in
her
mind.
The
fact
that
she
still
was
having
trouble
comprehending
exactly
what
took
place
wasn't
helping
the
matter.
She
thought
if
she
could
just
get
a
little
rest
the
entire
incident
might
make
a
little
more
sense.
Finding
the
red
rose
in
the
mailbox
was
a
pleasant
surprise
for
Sarah.
She
didn't
have
a
boyfriend
or
know
of
anyone
who
was
interested
in
her
as
anything
more
than
a
friend.
There
wasn't
even
a
note
attached
to
it.
Although
it
was
a
complete
mystery,
it
still
made
her
heart
jump
and
race
a
little
more
than
usual.
She
wished
that
she
could
simply
accept
the
gesture
and
be
content
knowing
someone
had
given
it
to
her,
but
that
wasn't
the
way
Sarah
did
things.
Now
it
was
time
to
do
a
little
detective
work
and
try
to
figure
who
had
actually
left
the
red
rose.
The
rain
was
coming.
Everyone
thought
this
would
be
a
good
thing.
It
hadn't
rained
in
months
and
the
earth
was
dry
as
a
bone.
It
wasn't
a
surprise
that
everyone
thought
a
good
rain
was
what
was
needed,
but
they
never
expected
how
much
rain
would
actually
arrive.
He
was
after
the
truth.
At
least,
that's
what
he
told
himself.
He
believed
it,
but
any
rational
person
on
the
outside
could
see
he
was
lying
to
himself.
It
was
apparent
he
was
really
only
after
his
own
truth
that
he'd
already
decided
and
was
after
this
truth
because
the
facts
didn't
line
up
with
the
truth
he
wanted.
So
he
continued
to
tell
everyone
he
was
after
the
truth
oblivious
to
the
real
truth
sitting
right
in
front
of
him.
They
rushed
out
the
door,
grabbing
anything
and
everything
they
could
think
of
they
might
need.
There
was
no
time
to
double-check
to
make
sure
they
weren't
leaving
something
important
behind.
Everything
was
thrown
into
the
car
and
they
sped
off.
Thirty
minutes
later
they
were
safe
and
that
was
when
it
dawned
on
them
that
they
had
forgotten
the
most
important
thing
of
all.
It's
an
unfortunate
reality
that
we
don't
teach
people
how
to
make
money
(beyond
getting
a
9
to
5
job)
as
part
of
our
education
system.
The
truth
is
there
are
a
lot
of
different,
legitimate
ways
to
make
money.
That
doesn't
mean
they
are
easy
and
that
you
won't
have
to
work
hard
to
succeed,
but
it
does
mean
that
if
you're
willing
to
open
your
mind
a
bit
you
don't
have
to
be
stuck
in
an
office
from
9
to
5
for
the
next
fifty
years
o
your
life.
I'm
heading
back
to
Colorado
tomorrow
after
being
down
in
Santa
Barbara
over
the
weekend
for
the
festival
there.
I
will
be
making
October
plans
once
there
and
will
try
to
arrange
so
I'm
back
here
for
the
birthday
if
possible.
I'll
let
you
know
as
soon
as
I
know
the
doctor's
appointment
schedule
and
my
flight
plans.
It
was
supposed
to
be
a
dream
vacation.
They
had
planned
it
over
a
year
in
advance
so
that
it
would
be
perfect
in
every
way.
It
had
been
what
they
had
been
looking
forward
to
through
all
the
turmoil
and
negativity
around
them.
It
had
been
the
light
at
the
end
of
both
their
tunnels.
Now
that
the
dream
vacation
was
only
a
week
away,
the
virus
had
stopped
all
air
travel.
Wandering
down
the
path
to
the
pond
had
become
a
daily
routine.
Even
when
the
weather
wasn't
cooperating
like
today
with
the
wind
and
rain,
Jerry
still
took
the
morning
stroll
down
the
path
until
he
reached
the
pond.
Although
there
didn't
seem
to
be
a
particular
reason
Jerry
did
this
to
anyone
looking
in
from
the
outside,
those
who
knew
him
well
knew
exactly
what
was
going
on.
It
could
all
be
traced
back
to
a
specific
incident
that
happened
exactly
5
years
previously.
He
stared
out
the
window
at
the
snowy
field.
He'd
been
stuck
in
the
house
for
close
to
a
month
and
his
only
view
of
the
outside
world
was
through
the
window.
There
wasn't
much
to
see.
It
was
mostly
just
the
field
with
an
occasional
bird
or
small
animal
who
ventured
into
the
field.
As
he
continued
to
stare
out
the
window,
he
wondered
how
much
longer
he'd
be
shackled
to
the
steel
bar
inside
the
house.
He
swung
back
the
fishing
pole
and
cast
the
line
which
ell
25
feet
away
into
the
river.
The
lure
landed
in
the
perfect
spot
and
he
was
sure
he
would
soon
get
a
bite.
He
never
expected
that
the
bite
would
come
from
behind
in
the
form
of
a
bear.
The
amber
droplet
hung
from
the
branch,
reaching
fullness
and
ready
to
drop.
It
waited.
While
many
of
the
other
droplets
were
satisfied
to
form
as
big
as
they
could
and
release,
this
droplet
had
other
plans.
It
wanted
to
be
part
of
history.
It
wanted
to
be
remembered
long
after
all
the
other
droplets
had
dissolved
into
history.
So
it
waited
for
the
perfect
specimen
to
fly
by
to
trap
and
capture
that
it
hoped
would
eventually
be
discovered
hundreds
of
years
in
the
future.
Mary
had
to
make
a
decision
and
she
knew
that
whatever
decision
she
made,
it
would
upset
someone.
It
seemed
like
such
a
silly
reason
for
people
to
get
upset
but
she
knew
the
minute
that
she
began
to
consider
doing
it
that
there
was
no
way
everyone
in
her
life
would
be
pleased
with
what
she
ultimately
decided
to
do.
It
was
simply
a
question
of
who
she
would
rather
displease
most.
While
this
had
always
been
her
parents,
and
especially
her
mom,
in
the
past
that
she
tried
to
keep
from
upsetting,
she
decided
that
this
time
the
person
she
was
going
to
please
the
most
with
her
decision
was
herself.
She
wanted
rainbow
hair.
That's
what
she
told
the
hairdresser.
It
should
be
deep
rainbow
colors,
too.
She
wasn't
interested
in
pastel
rainbow
hair.
She
wanted
it
deep
and
vibrant
so
there
was
no
doubt
that
she
had
done
this
on
purpose.
Benny
was
tired.
Not
the
normal
every
day
tired
from
a
hard
day
o
work.
The
exhausted
type
of
tired
where
you're
surprised
your
body
can
even
move.
All
he
wanted
to
do
was
sit
in
front
of
the
TV,
put
his
feet
up
on
the
coffee
table,
and
drink
a
beer.
The
only
issue
was
that
he
had
forgotten
where
he
lived.
He
lifted
the
bottle
to
his
lips
and
took
a
sip
of
the
drink.
He
had
tasted
this
before,
but
he
couldn't
quite
remember
the
time
and
place
it
had
happened.
He
desperately
searched
his
mind
trying
to
locate
and
remember
where
he
had
tasted
this
when
the
bicycle
ran
over
his
foot.
She
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
could
tell
a
lot
about
a
person
by
their
ears.
The
way
they
stuck
out
and
the
size
of
the
earlobes
could
give
you
wonderful
insights
into
the
person.
Of
course,
she
couldn't
scientifically
prove
any
of
this,
but
that
didn't
matter
to
her.
Before
anything
else,
she
would
size
up
the
ears
of
the
person
she
was
talking
to.
Eating
raw
fish
didn't
sound
like
a
good
idea.
"It's
a
delicacy
in
Japan,"
didn't
seem
to
make
it
any
more
appetizing.
Raw
fish
is
raw
fish,
delicacy
or
not.
I
checked
in
for
the
night
at
Out
O
The
Way
motel.
What
a
bad
choice
that
was.
First
I
took
a
shower
and
a
spider
crawled
out
of
the
drain.
Next,
the
towel
rack
fell
down
when
I
reached
for
the
one
small
bath
towel.
This
allowed
the
towel
to
fall
halfway
into
the
toilet.
I
tried
to
watch
a
movie,
but
the
remote
control
was
sticky
and
wouldn’t
stop
scrolling
through
the
channels.
I
gave
up
for
the
night
and
crawled
into
bed.
I
stretched
out
my
leg
and
felt
something
furry
by
my
foot.
Filled
with
fear,
I
reached
down
and
to
my
surprise,
I
pulled
out
a
raccoon
skin
pair
of
underwear.
After
my
initial
relief
that
it
wasn’t
alive,
the
image
of
a
fat,
ugly
businessman
wearing
raccoon
skin
briefs
filled
my
brain.
I
jumped
out
of
the
bed,
threw
my
toothbrush
into
my
bag,
and
sprinted
towards
my
car.
Don't
forget
that
gifts
often
come
with
costs
that
go
beyond
their
purchase
price.
When
you
purchase
a
child
the
latest
smartphone,
you're
also
committing
to
a
monthly
phone
bill.
When
you
purchase
the
latest
gaming
system,
you're
likely
not
going
to
be
satisfied
with
the
games
that
come
with
it
for
long
and
want
to
purchase
new
titles
to
play.
When
you
buy
gifts
it's
important
to
remember
that
some
come
with
additional
costs
down
the
road
that
can
be
much
more
expensive
than
the
initial
gift
itself.
The
desert
wind
blew
the
tumbleweed
in
front
of
the
car.
Alex
swerved
to
avoid
the
tumbleweed,
but
he
turned
the
wheel
a
bit
too
strong
and
the
car
left
the
road
and
skidded
onto
the
dirt
median.
He
instantly
slammed
on
the
brakes
and
the
car
stopped
in
a
cloud
of
dirt.
When
the
dust
cloud
had
settled
and
he
could
see
around
him
again,
he
realized
that
he'd
somehow
crossed
over
into
an
entirely
new
dimension.
The
piano
sat
silently
in
the
corner
of
the
room.
Nobody
could
remember
the
last
time
it
had
been
played.
The
little
girl
walked
up
to
it
and
hit
a
few
of
the
keys.
The
sound
of
the
piano
rang
throughout
the
house
for
the
first
time
in
years.
In
the
upstairs
room,
confined
to
her
bed,
the
owner
of
the
house
had
tears
in
her
eyes.
He
heard
the
loud
impact
before
he
ever
saw
the
result.
It
had
been
so
loud
that
it
had
actually
made
him
jump
back
in
his
seat.
As
soon
as
he
recovered
from
the
surprise,
he
saw
the
crack
in
the
windshield.
It
seemed
to
be
an
analogy
of
the
current
condition
of
his
life.
There
had
to
be
a
better
way.
That's
all
Nancy
could
think
as
she
sat
at
her
desk
staring
at
her
computer
screen.
She'd
already
spent
five
years
of
her
life
in
this
little
cubicle
staring
at
her
computer
doing
"work"
that
didn't
seem
to
matter
to
anyone
including
her
own
boss.
There
had
to
be
more
to
her
life
than
this
and
there
had
to
be
a
better
way
to
make
a
living.
That's
what
she
was
thinking
when
the
earthquake
struck.
He
slowly
poured
the
drink
over
a
large
chunk
of
ice
he
has
especially
chiseled
off
a
larger
block.
He
didn't
particularly
like
his
drinks
cold,
but
he
knew
that
the
drama
of
chiseling
the
ice
and
then
pouring
a
drink
over
it
looked
far
more
impressive
than
how
he
actually
liked
it.
It
was
all
about
image
and
he'd
managed
to
perfect
the
image
that
he
wanted
to
project.
He
heard
the
crack
echo
in
the
late
afternoon
about
a
mile
away.
His
heart
started
racing
and
he
bolted
into
a
full
sprint.
"It
wasn't
a
gunshot,
it
wasn't
a
gunshot,"
he
repeated
under
his
breathlessness
as
he
continued
to
sprint.
The
blinking
light
caught
her
attention.
She
thought
about
it
a
bit
and
couldn't
remember
ever
noticing
it
before.
That
was
strange
since
it
was
obvious
the
flashing
light
had
been
there
for
years.
Now
she
wondered
how
she
missed
it
for
that
amount
of
time
and
what
other
things
in
her
small
town
she
had
failed
to
notice.
There
were
a
variety
of
ways
to
win
the
game.
James
had
played
it
long
enough
to
know
most
of
them
and
he
could
see
what
his
opponent
was
trying
to
do.
There
was
a
simple
counterattack
that
James
could
use
and
the
game
should
be
his.
He
began
deploying
it
with
the
confidence
of
a
veteran
player
who
had
been
in
this
situation
a
thousand
times
in
the
past.
So,
it
was
with
great
surprise
when
his
opponent
used
a
move
he
had
never
before
seen
or
anticipated
to
easily
defeat
him
in
the
game.
They
told
her
that
this
was
her
once
chance
to
show
the
world
what
she
was
made
of.
She
believed
them
at
the
time.
It
was
the
big
stage
and
she
knew
the
world
would
be
there
to
see.
The
only
one
who
had
disagreed
with
this
sentiment
was
her
brother.
He
had
told
her
that
you
don't
show
the
world
what
you're
made
of
when
they
are
all
watching,
you
show
that
in
your
actions
when
nobody
was
looking.
It
was
looking
more
and
more
like
her
brother
was
correct.
They
had
always
called
it
the
green
river.
It
made
sense.
The
river
was
green.
The
river
likely
had
a
different
official
name,
but
to
everyone
in
town,
it
was
and
had
always
been
the
green
river.
So
it
was
with
great
surprise
that
on
this
day
the
green
river
was
a
fluorescent
pink.
It
seemed
like
it
should
have
been
so
simple.
There
was
nothing
inherently
difficult
with
getting
the
project
done.
It
was
simple
and
straightforward
enough
that
even
a
child
should
have
been
able
to
complete
it
on
time,
but
that
wasn't
the
case.
The
deadline
had
arrived
and
the
project
remained
unfinished.
She
counted.
One.
She
could
hear
the
steps
coming
closer.
Two.
Puffs
of
breath
could
be
seen
coming
from
his
mouth.
Three.
He
stopped
beside
her.
Four.
She
pulled
the
trigger
of
the
gun.
The
wave
roared
towards
them
with
speed
and
violence
they
had
not
anticipated.
They
both
turned
to
run
but
by
that
time
it
was
too
late.
The
wave
crashed
into
their
legs
sweeping
both
of
them
off
of
their
feet.
They
now
found
themselves
in
a
washing
machine
of
saltwater,
getting
tumbled
and
not
know
what
was
up
or
down.
Both
were
scared,
not
knowing
how
this
was
going
to
end,
but
it
was
by
far
the
best
time
of
the
trip
thus
far.
Dragons
don't
exist
they
said.
They
are
the
stuff
of
legend
and
people's
imagination.
Greg
would
have
agreed
with
this
assessment
without
a
second
thought
24
hours
ago.
But
now
that
there
was
a
dragon
staring
directly
into
his
eyes,
he
questioned
everything
that
he
had
been
told.
Matt
told
her
to
reach
for
the
stars,
but
Veronica
thought
it
was
the
most
ridiculous
advice
she'd
ever
received.
Sure,
it
had
been
well-meaning
when
he
said
it,
but
she
didn't
understand
why
anyone
would
want
to
suggest
something
that
would
literally
kill
you
if
you
actually
managed
to
achieve
it.
Have
you
ever
wondered
about
toes?
Why
10
toes
and
not
12.
Why
are
some
bigger
than
others?
Some
people
can
use
their
toes
to
pick
up
things
while
others
can
barely
move
them
on
command.
Some
toes
are
nice
to
look
at
while
others
are
definitely
not
something
you
want
to
look
at.
Toes
can
be
stubbed
and
make
us
scream.
Toes
help
us
balance
and
walk.
10
toes
are
just
something
to
ponder.
The
song
came
from
the
bathroom
belting
over
the
sound
of
the
shower's
running
water.
It
was
the
same
way
each
day
began
since
he
could
remember.
It
listened
intently
and
concluded
that
the
singing
today
was
as
terrible
as
it
had
ever
been.
I
guess
we
could
discuss
the
implications
of
the
phrase
"meant
to
be."
That
is
if
we
wanted
to
drown
ourselves
in
a
sea
of
backwardly
referential
semantics
and
other
mumbo-jumbo.
Maybe
such
a
discussion
would
result
in
the
determination
that
"meant
to
be"
is
exactly
as
meaningless
a
phrase
as
it
seems
to
be,
and
that
none
of
us
is
actually
meant
to
be
doing
anything
at
all.
But
that's
my
existential
underpants
underpinnings
showing.
It's
the
way
the
cookie
crumbles.
And
now
I
want
a
cookie.
Don't
be
scared.
The
things
out
there
that
are
unknown
aren't
scary
in
themselves.
They
are
just
unknown
at
the
moment.
Take
the
time
to
know
them
before
you
list
them
as
scary.
Then
the
world
will
be
a
much
less
scary
place
for
you.
Should
he
write
it
down?
That
was
the
question
running
through
his
mind.
He
couldn't
believe
what
had
just
happened
and
he
knew
nobody
else
would
believe
him
as
well.
Even
if
he
documented
what
had
happened
by
writing
it
down,
he
still
didn't
believe
anyone
would
still
believe
it.
So
the
question
remained.
Was
it
be
worth
it
to
actually
write
it
down?
The
shoes
had
been
there
for
as
long
as
anyone
could
remember.
In
fact,
it
was
difficult
for
anyone
to
come
up
with
a
date
they
had
first
appeared.
It
had
seemed
they'd
always
been
there
and
yet
they
seemed
so
out
of
place.
Why
nobody
had
removed
them
was
a
question
that
had
been
asked
time
and
again,
but
while
they
all
thought
it,
nobody
had
ever
found
the
energy
to
actually
do
it.
So,
the
shoes
remained
on
the
steps,
out
of
place
in
one
sense,
but
perfectly
normal
in
another.
I
inadvertently
went
to
See's
Candy
last
week
(I
was
in
the
mall
looking
for
phone
repair),
and
as
it
turns
out,
See's
Candy
now
charges
a
dollar
--
a
full
dollar
--
for
even
the
simplest
of
their
wee
confection
offerings.
I
bought
two
chocolate
lollipops
and
two
chocolate-caramel-almond
things.
The
total
cost
was
four-something.
I
mean,
the
candies
were
tasty
and
all,
but
let's
be
real:
A
Snickers
bar
is
fifty
cents.
After
this
dollar-per-candy
revelation,
I
may
not
find
myself
wandering
dreamily
back
into
a
See's
Candy
any
time
soon.
She
nervously
peered
over
the
edge.
She
understood
in
her
mind
that
the
view
was
supposed
to
be
beautiful,
but
all
she
felt
was
fear.
There
had
always
been
something
about
heights
that
disturbed
her,
and
now
she
could
feel
the
full
force
of
this
unease.
She
reluctantly
crept
a
little
closer
with
the
encouragement
of
her
friends
as
the
fear
continued
to
build.
She
couldn't
help
but
feel
that
something
horrible
was
about
to
happen.
He
walked
down
the
steps
from
the
train
station
in
a
bit
of
a
hurry
knowing
the
secrets
in
the
briefcase
must
be
secured
as
quickly
as
possible.
Bounding
down
the
steps,
he
heard
something
behind
him
and
quickly
turned
in
a
panic.
There
was
nobody
there
but
a
pair
of
old
worn-out
shoes
were
placed
neatly
on
the
steps
he
had
just
come
down.
Had
he
past
them
without
seeing
them?
It
didn't
seem
possible.
He
was
about
to
turn
and
be
on
his
way
when
a
deep
chill
filled
his
body.
"Begin
today!"
That's
all
the
note
said.
There
was
no
indication
from
where
it
came
or
who
may
have
written
it.
Had
it
been
meant
for
someone
else?
Meghan
looked
around
the
room,
but
nobody
made
eye
contact
back.
For
a
brief
moment,
she
thought
it
might
be
a
message
for
her
to
follow
her
dreams,
but
ultimately
decided
it
was
easier
to
ignore
it
as
she
crumpled
it
up
and
threw
it
away.
I
don’t
like
cats
and
they
don’t
like
me.
I
used
to
be
allergic
to
them
and
I
would
get
stuffed
up
and
have
hives.
That
doesn’t
seem
to
happen
anymore.
But
I
still
don’t
like
them.
I
lived
with
3
cats
that
were
not
good
at
peeing
in
the
litter
box.
They
seemed
to
find
something
important
to
me
and
pee
on
it.
Most
of
the
time
they
peed
on
photographs
or
papers
that
would
be
ruined.
Cats
also
bring
fleas
into
the
house.
There
is
nothing
worse
than
having
to
flea
dip
cats
and
also
flea
bomb
a
home.
That
is
why
I
don’t
like
cats.
"It
was
so
great
to
hear
from
you
today
and
it
was
such
weird
timing,"
he
said.
"This
is
going
to
sound
funny
and
a
little
strange,
but
you
were
in
a
dream
I
had
just
a
couple
of
days
ago.
I'd
love
to
get
together
and
tell
you
about
it
if
you're
up
for
a
cup
of
coffee,"
he
continued,
laying
the
trap
he'd
been
planning
for
years.
Welcome
to
my
world.
You
will
be
greeted
by
the
unexpected
here
and
your
mind
will
be
challenged
and
expanded
in
ways
that
you
never
thought
possible.
That
is
if
you
are
able
to
survive...
There
weren't
supposed
to
be
dragons
flying
in
the
sky.
First
and
foremost,
dragons
didn't
exist.
They
were
mythical
creatures
from
fantasy
books
like
unicorns.
This
was
something
that
Pete
knew
in
his
heart
to
be
true
so
he
was
having
a
difficult
time
acknowledging
that
there
were
actually
fire-breathing
dragons
flying
in
the
sky
above
him.
She
wanted
rainbow
hair.
That's
what
she
told
the
hairdresser.
It
should
be
deep
rainbow
colors,
too.
She
wasn't
interested
in
pastel
rainbow
hair.
She
wanted
it
deep
and
vibrant
so
there
was
no
doubt
that
she
had
done
this
on
purpose.
"Explain
to
me
again
why
I
shouldn't
cheat?"
he
asked.
"All
the
others
do
and
nobody
ever
gets
punished
for
doing
so.
I
should
go
about
being
happy
losing
to
cheaters
because
I
know
that
I
don't?
That's
what
you're
telling
me?"
It
was
hidden
under
the
log
beside
the
stream.
It
had
been
there
for
as
long
as
Jerry
had
been
alive.
He
wasn't
sure
if
anyone
besides
him
and
his
friends
knew
of
its
existence.
He
knew
that
anyone
could
potentially
find
it,
but
it
was
well
enough
hidden
that
it
seemed
unlikely
to
happen.
The
fact
that
it
had
been
there
for
more
than
30
years
attested
to
this.
So
it
was
quite
a
surprise
when
he
found
the
item
was
missing.
He
had
done
everything
right.
There
had
been
no
mistakes
throughout
the
entire
process.
It
had
been
perfection
and
he
knew
it
without
a
doubt,
but
the
results
still
stared
back
at
him
with
the
fact
that
he
had
lost.
The
alarm
went
off
and
Jake
rose
awake.
Rising
early
had
become
a
daily
ritual,
one
that
he
could
not
fully
explain.
From
the
outside,
it
was
a
wonder
that
he
was
able
to
get
up
so
early
each
morning
for
someone
who
had
absolutely
no
plans
to
be
productive
during
the
entire
day.
Brock
would
have
never
dared
to
do
it
on
his
own
he
thought
to
himself.
That
is
why
Kenneth
and
he
had
become
such
good
friends.
Kenneth
forced
Brock
out
of
his
comfort
zone
and
made
him
try
new
things
he'd
never
imagine
doing
otherwise.
Up
to
this
point,
this
had
been
a
good
thing.
It
had
expanded
Brock's
experiences
and
given
him
a
new
appreciation
for
life.
Now
that
both
of
them
were
in
the
back
of
a
police
car,
all
Brock
could
think
was
that
he
would
have
never
dared
do
it
except
for
the
influence
of
Kenneth.
Devon
couldn't
figure
out
the
color
of
her
eyes.
He
initially
would
have
guessed
that
they
were
green,
but
the
more
he
looked
at
them
he
almost
wanted
to
say
they
were
a
golden
yellow.
Then
there
were
the
flashes
of
red
and
orange
that
seemed
to
be
streaked
throughout
them.
It
was
almost
as
if
her
eyes
were
made
of
opal
with
the
sun
constantly
glinting
off
of
them
and
bringing
out
more
color.
They
were
definitely
the
most
unusual
pair
of
eyes
he'd
ever
seen.
He
couldn't
remember
exactly
where
he
had
read
it,
but
he
was
sure
that
he
had.
The
fact
that
she
didn't
believe
him
was
quite
frustrating
as
he
began
to
search
the
Internet
to
find
the
article.
It
wasn't
as
if
it
was
something
that
seemed
impossible.
Yet
she
insisted
on
always
seeing
the
source
whenever
he
stated
a
fact.
Green
vines
attached
to
the
trunk
of
the
tree
had
wound
themselves
toward
the
top
of
the
canopy.
Ants
used
the
vine
as
their
private
highway,
avoiding
all
the
creases
and
crags
of
the
bark,
to
freely
move
at
top
speed
from
top
to
bottom
or
bottom
to
top
depending
on
their
current
chore.
At
least
this
was
the
way
it
was
supposed
to
be.
Something
had
damaged
the
vine
overnight
halfway
up
the
tree
leaving
a
gap
in
the
once
pristine
ant
highway.
There
was
a
leak
in
the
boat.
Nobody
had
yet
noticed
it,
and
nobody
would
for
the
next
couple
of
hours.
This
was
a
problem
since
the
boat
was
heading
out
to
sea
and
while
the
leak
was
quite
small
at
the
moment,
it
would
be
much
larger
when
it
was
ultimately
discovered.
John
had
planned
it
exactly
this
way.
As
she
sat
watching
the
world
go
by,
something
caught
her
eye.
It
wasn't
so
much
its
color
or
shape,
but
the
way
it
was
moving.
She
squinted
to
see
if
she
could
better
understand
what
it
was
and
where
it
was
going,
but
it
didn't
help.
As
she
continued
to
stare
into
the
distance,
she
didn't
understand
why
this
uneasiness
was
building
inside
her
body.
She
felt
like
she
should
get
up
and
run.
If
only
she
could
make
out
what
it
was.
At
that
moment,
she
comprehended
what
it
was
and
where
it
was
heading,
and
she
knew
her
life
would
never
be
the
same.
Twenty
seconds
were
all
that
was
left
and
Richard
could
hear
each
one
tick
by.
Fifteen
seconds
now
remained
and
the
panic
began
to
fully
set
in.
Ten
seconds
and
he
wasn't
sure
he
had
enough
time.
Five
seconds,
four,
three,
two,
one...
They
had
always
called
it
the
green
river.
It
made
sense.
The
river
was
green.
The
river
likely
had
a
different
official
name,
but
to
everyone
in
town,
it
was
and
had
always
been
the
green
river.
So
it
was
with
great
surprise
that
on
this
day
the
green
river
was
a
fluorescent
pink.
Don't
forget
that
gifts
often
come
with
costs
that
go
beyond
their
purchase
price.
When
you
purchase
a
child
the
latest
smartphone,
you're
also
committing
to
a
monthly
phone
bill.
When
you
purchase
the
latest
gaming
system,
you're
likely
not
going
to
be
satisfied
with
the
games
that
come
with
it
for
long
and
want
to
purchase
new
titles
to
play.
When
you
buy
gifts
it's
important
to
remember
that
some
come
with
additional
costs
down
the
road
that
can
be
much
more
expensive
than
the
initial
gift
itself.
The
picket
fence
had
stood
for
years
without
any
issue.
That's
all
it
was.
A
simple,
white,
picket
fence.
Why
it
had
all
of
a
sudden
become
a
lightning
rod
within
the
community
was
still
unbelievable
to
most.
Yet
a
community
that
had
once
lived
in
harmony
was
now
divided
in
bitter
hatred
and
it
had
everything
to
do
with
the
white
picket
fence.
"It
doesn't
take
much
to
touch
someone's
heart,"
Daisy
said
with
a
smile
on
her
face.
"It's
often
just
the
little
things
you
do
that
can
change
a
person's
day
for
the
better."
Daisy
truly
believed
this
to
be
the
way
the
world
worked,
but
she
didn't
understand
that
she
was
merely
a
robot
that
had
been
programmed
to
believe
this.
Wandering
down
the
path
to
the
pond
had
become
a
daily
routine.
Even
when
the
weather
wasn't
cooperating
like
today
with
the
wind
and
rain,
Jerry
still
took
the
morning
stroll
down
the
path
until
he
reached
the
pond.
Although
there
didn't
seem
to
be
a
particular
reason
Jerry
did
this
to
anyone
looking
in
from
the
outside,
those
who
knew
him
well
knew
exactly
what
was
going
on.
It
could
all
be
traced
back
to
a
specific
incident
that
happened
exactly
5
years
previously.
She
tried
to
explain
that
love
wasn't
like
pie.
There
wasn't
a
set
number
of
slices
to
be
given
out.
There
wasn't
less
to
be
given
to
one
person
if
you
wanted
to
give
more
to
another.
That
after
a
set
amount
was
given
out
it
would
all
disappear.
She
tried
to
explain
this,
but
it
fell
on
deaf
ears.
He
read
about
a
hike
called
the
incline
in
the
guidebook.
It
said
it
was
a
strenuous
hike
and
to
bring
plenty
of
water.
“A
beautiful
hike
to
the
clouds”
described
one
review.
“Not
for
the
faint-hearted,”
said
another.
“Not
too
bad
of
a
workout”,
bragged
a
third
review.
I
thought
I’d
hike
it
when
I
fly
in
from
Maryland
on
my
day
off
from
the
senior
citizen's
wellness
conference.
I
hiked
2
miles
a
day
around
the
neighborhood
so
I
could
handle
a
1.1-mile
hike.
What
a
foolish
mistake
that
was
for
a
70-year-old
low-lander.
The
amber
droplet
hung
from
the
branch,
reaching
fullness
and
ready
to
drop.
It
waited.
While
many
of
the
other
droplets
were
satisfied
to
form
as
big
as
they
could
and
release,
this
droplet
had
other
plans.
It
wanted
to
be
part
of
history.
It
wanted
to
be
remembered
long
after
all
the
other
droplets
had
dissolved
into
history.
So
it
waited
for
the
perfect
specimen
to
fly
by
to
trap
and
capture
that
it
hoped
would
eventually
be
discovered
hundreds
of
years
in
the
future.
It
really
doesn't
matter
what
she
thinks
as
it
isn't
her
problem
to
solve.
That's
what
he
kept
trying
to
convince
himself.
She
was
trying
to
insert
her
opinion
where
it
wasn't
wanted
or
welcome.
He
already
had
a
plan
and
even
though
that
plan
didn't
correspond
with
what
she
wanted
him
to
do
or
what
should
be
done,
it
wasn't
her
decision
to
make.
The
question
now
became
whether
he
would
stick
to
his
convictions
and
go
through
with
his
plan
knowing
she
wouldn't
approve.
I
recently
discovered
I
could
make
fudge
with
just
chocolate
chips,
sweetened
condensed
milk,
vanilla
extract,
and
a
thick
pot
on
slow
heat.
I
tried
it
with
dark
chocolate
chunks
and
I
tried
it
with
semi-sweet
chocolate
chips.
It's
better
with
both
kinds.
It
comes
out
pretty
bad
with
just
the
dark
chocolate.
The
best
add-ins
are
crushed
almonds
and
marshmallows
--
what
you
get
from
that
is
Rocky
Road.
It
takes
about
twenty
minutes
from
start
to
fridge,
and
then
it
takes
about
six
months
to
work
off
the
twenty
pounds
you
gain
from
eating
it.
All
things
in
moderation,
friends.
All
things
in
moderation.
Rhonda
prided
herself
on
always
taking
the
path
less
traveled.
She'd
decided
to
do
this
at
an
early
age
and
had
continued
to
do
so
throughout
her
entire
life.
It
was
a
point
of
pride
and
she
would
explain
to
anyone
who
would
listen
that
doing
so
was
something
that
she'd
made
great
efforts
to
always
do.
She'd
never
questioned
this
decision
until
her
five-year-old
niece
asked
her,
"So,
is
this
why
your
life
has
been
so
difficult?"
and
Rhonda
didn't
have
an
answer
for
her.
Dave
wasn't
exactly
sure
how
he
had
ended
up
in
this
predicament.
He
ran
through
all
the
events
that
had
lead
to
this
current
situation
and
it
still
didn't
make
sense.
He
wanted
to
spend
some
time
to
try
and
make
sense
of
it
all,
but
he
had
higher
priorities
at
the
moment.
The
first
was
how
to
get
out
of
his
current
situation
of
being
naked
in
a
tree
with
snow
falling
all
around
and
no
way
for
him
to
get
down.
She
closed
her
eyes
and
then
opened
them
again.
What
she
was
seeing
just
didn't
make
sense.
She
shook
her
head
seeing
if
that
would
help.
It
didn't.
Although
it
seemed
beyond
reality,
there
was
no
denying
she
was
witnessing
a
large
formation
of
alien
spaceships
filling
the
sky.
"Do
Not
Enter."
The
sign
made
it
clear
that
they
didn't
want
anyone
around.
That
wasn't
going
to
stop
Jack.
Jack
always
lived
with
the
notion
that
signs
were
mere
suggestions,
not
actually
absolute
rules.
That's
why
the
moment
Jack
looked
at
the
"Do
Not
Enter"
sign,
he
walked
past
it
and
onto
their
property.
MaryLou
wore
the
tiara
with
pride.
There
was
something
that
made
doing
anything
she
didn't
really
want
to
do
a
bit
easier
when
she
wore
it.
She
really
didn't
care
what
those
staring
through
the
window
were
thinking
as
she
vacuumed
her
apartment.
She
looked
at
her
little
girl
who
was
about
to
become
a
teen.
She
tried
to
think
back
to
when
the
girl
had
been
younger
but
failed
to
pinpoint
the
exact
moment
when
she
had
become
a
little
too
big
to
pick
up
and
carry.
It
hit
her
all
at
once.
She
was
no
longer
a
little
girl
and
she
stood
there
speechless
with
fear,
sadness,
and
pride
all
running
through
her
at
the
same
time.
The
water
rush
down
the
wash
and
into
the
slot
canyon
below.
Two
hikers
had
started
the
day
to
sunny
weather
without
a
cloud
in
the
sky,
but
they
hadn't
thought
to
check
the
weather
north
of
the
canyon.
Huge
thunderstorms
had
brought
a
deluge
o
rain
and
produced
flash
floods
heading
their
way.
The
two
hikers
had
no
idea
what
was
coming.
It
was
that
terrifying
feeling
you
have
as
you
tightly
hold
the
covers
over
you
with
the
knowledge
that
there
is
something
hiding
under
your
bed.
You
want
to
look,
but
you
don't
at
the
same
time.
You're
frozen
with
fear
and
unable
to
act.
That's
where
she
found
herself
and
she
didn't
know
what
to
do
next
The
clowns
had
taken
over.
And
yes,
they
were
literally
clowns.
Over
100
had
appeared
out
of
a
small
VW
bug
that
had
been
driven
up
to
the
bank.
Now
they
were
all
inside
and
had
taken
it
over.
There
was
nothing
to
indicate
Nancy
was
going
to
change
the
world.
She
looked
like
an
average
girl
going
to
an
average
high
school.
It
was
the
fact
that
everything
about
her
seemed
average
that
would
end
up
becoming
her
superpower.
The
paper
was
blank.
It
shouldn't
have
been.
There
should
have
been
writing
on
the
paper,
at
least
a
paragraph
if
not
more.
The
fact
that
the
writing
wasn't
there
was
frustrating.
Actually,
it
was
even
more
than
frustrating.
It
was
downright
distressing.
There
was
a
time
when
he
would
have
embraced
the
change
that
was
coming.
In
his
youth,
he
sought
adventure
and
the
unknown,
but
that
had
been
years
ago.
He
wished
he
could
go
back
and
learn
to
find
the
excitement
that
came
with
change
but
it
was
useless.
That
curiosity
had
long
left
him
to
where
he
had
come
to
loathe
anything
that
put
him
out
of
his
comfort
zone.
It
was
their
first
date
and
she
had
been
looking
forward
to
it
the
entire
week.
She
had
her
eyes
on
him
for
months,
and
it
had
taken
a
convoluted
scheme
with
several
friends
to
make
it
happen,
but
he'd
finally
taken
the
hint
and
asked
her
out.
After
all
the
time
and
effort
she'd
invested
into
it,
she
never
thought
that
it
would
be
anything
but
wonderful.
It
goes
without
saying
that
things
didn't
work
out
quite
as
she
expected.
The
river
slowly
meandered
through
the
open
space.
It
had
hidden
secrets
that
it
didn't
want
to
reveal.
It
had
a
well-planned
strategy
to
appear
calm,
inviting,
and
appealing.
That's
how
the
river
lured
her
unknowing
victims
to
her
water's
edge.
There
were
only
two
ways
to
get
out
of
this
mess
if
they
all
worked
together.
The
problem
was
that
neither
was
all
that
appealing.
One
would
likely
cause
everyone
a
huge
amount
of
physical
pain
while
the
other
would
likely
end
up
with
everyone
in
jail.
In
Sam's
mind,
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do.
He
threw
everyone
else
under
the
bus
and
he
secretly
sprinted
away
leaving
the
others
to
take
the
fall
without
him.
It
was
a
scrape
that
he
hardly
noticed.
Sure,
there
was
a
bit
of
blood
but
it
was
minor
compared
to
most
of
the
other
cuts
and
bruises
he
acquired
on
his
adventures.
There
was
no
way
he
could
know
that
the
rock
that
produced
the
cut
had
alien
genetic
material
on
it
that
was
now
racing
through
his
bloodstream.
He
felt
perfectly
normal
and
continued
his
adventure
with
no
knowledge
of
what
was
about
to
happen
to
him.
Ten
more
steps.
If
he
could
take
ten
more
steps
it
would
be
over,
but
his
legs
wouldn't
move.
He
tried
to
will
them
to
work,
but
they
wouldn't
listen
to
his
brain.
Ten
more
steps
and
it
would
be
over
but
it
didn't
appear
he
would
be
able
to
do
it.
It
really
didn't
matter
what
they
did
to
him.
He's
already
made
up
his
mind.
Whatever
came
his
way,
he
was
prepared
for
the
consequences.
He
knew
in
his
heart
that
the
sacrifice
he
made
was
done
with
love
and
not
hate
no
matter
how
others
decided
to
spin
it.
It
had
been
a
late
night.
To
be
more
correct,
it
had
been
an
early
morning.
It
was
now
3:00
AM
and
George
was
just
getting
home.
He
wasn't
sure
if
it
had
been
worth
it.
He
was
supposed
to
have
been
finished
by
10:00
PM,
but
his
boss
had
implored
him
to
stay
and
help
when
it
was
clear
they
weren't
going
to
meet
the
10:00
PM
target
time.
So,
he
had
stayed
an
extra
5
hours
and
lost
a
good
night's
sleep
for
something
he
didn't
really
believe
in,
but
he
did
anyway
because
he
was
afraid
if
he
refused
he
might
lose
his
job.
Dave
wasn't
exactly
sure
how
he
had
ended
up
in
this
predicament.
He
ran
through
all
the
events
that
had
lead
to
this
current
situation
and
it
still
didn't
make
sense.
He
wanted
to
spend
some
time
to
try
and
make
sense
of
it
all,
but
he
had
higher
priorities
at
the
moment.
The
first
was
how
to
get
out
of
his
current
situation
of
being
naked
in
a
tree
with
snow
falling
all
around
and
no
way
for
him
to
get
down.
Was
it
enough?
That
was
the
question
he
kept
asking
himself.
Was
being
satisfied
enough?
He
looked
around
him
at
everyone
yearning
to
just
be
satisfied
in
their
daily
life
and
he
had
reached
that
goal.
He
knew
that
he
was
satisfied
and
he
also
knew
it
wasn't
going
to
be
enough.
Her
mom
had
warned
her.
She
had
been
warned
time
and
again,
but
she
had
refused
to
believe
her.
She
had
done
everything
right
and
she
knew
she
would
be
rewarded
for
doing
so
with
the
promotion.
So
when
the
promotion
was
given
to
her
main
rival,
it
not
only
stung,
it
threw
her
belief
system
into
disarray.
It
was
her
first
big
lesson
in
life,
but
not
the
last.
He
heard
the
loud
impact
before
he
ever
saw
the
result.
It
had
been
so
loud
that
it
had
actually
made
him
jump
back
in
his
seat.
As
soon
as
he
recovered
from
the
surprise,
he
saw
the
crack
in
the
windshield.
It
seemed
to
be
an
analogy
of
the
current
condition
of
his
life.
He
slowly
poured
the
drink
over
a
large
chunk
of
ice
he
has
especially
chiseled
off
a
larger
block.
He
didn't
particularly
like
his
drinks
cold,
but
he
knew
that
the
drama
of
chiseling
the
ice
and
then
pouring
a
drink
over
it
looked
far
more
impressive
than
how
he
actually
liked
it.
It
was
all
about
image
and
he'd
managed
to
perfect
the
image
that
he
wanted
to
project.
The
red
line
moved
across
the
page.
With
each
millimeter
it
advanced
forward,
something
changed
in
the
room.
The
actual
change
taking
place
was
difficult
to
perceive,
but
the
change
was
real.
The
red
line
continued
relentlessly
across
the
page
and
the
room
would
never
be
the
same.
It's
always
good
to
bring
a
slower
friend
with
you
on
a
hike.
If
you
happen
to
come
across
bears,
the
whole
group
doesn't
have
to
worry.
Only
the
slowest
in
the
group
do.
That
was
the
lesson
they
were
about
to
learn
that
day.
The
piano
sat
silently
in
the
corner
of
the
room.
Nobody
could
remember
the
last
time
it
had
been
played.
The
little
girl
walked
up
to
it
and
hit
a
few
of
the
keys.
The
sound
of
the
piano
rang
throughout
the
house
for
the
first
time
in
years.
In
the
upstairs
room,
confined
to
her
bed,
the
owner
of
the
house
had
tears
in
her
eyes.
They
had
made
it
to
Las
Vegas,
wide-eyed
and
with
so
much
hope
and
energy.
They
had
planned
the
trip
for
more
than
a
year
and
both
were
so
excited
they
could
barely
control
themselves.
They
still
hadn't
realized
that
Las
Vegas
promised
a
place
where
dreams
come
true,
it
was
actually
the
place
where
dreams
came
to
die.
There
was
a
time
when
this
wouldn't
have
bothered
her.
The
fact
that
it
did
actually
bother
her
bothered
her
even
more.
What
had
changed
in
her
life
that
such
a
small
thing
could
annoy
her
so
much
for
the
entire
day?
She
knew
it
was
ridiculous
that
she
even
took
notice
of
it,
yet
she
was
still
obsessing
over
it
as
she
tried
to
fall
asleep.
It
was
that
terrifying
feeling
you
have
as
you
tightly
hold
the
covers
over
you
with
the
knowledge
that
there
is
something
hiding
under
your
bed.
You
want
to
look,
but
you
don't
at
the
same
time.
You're
frozen
with
fear
and
unable
to
act.
That's
where
she
found
herself
and
she
didn't
know
what
to
do
next
You
know
that
tingly
feeling
you
get
on
the
back
of
your
neck
sometimes?
I
just
got
that
feeling
when
talking
with
her.
You
know
I
don't
believe
in
sixth
senses,
but
there
is
something
not
right
with
her.
I
don't
know
how
I
know,
but
I
just
do.
He
swung
back
the
fishing
pole
and
cast
the
line
which
ell
25
feet
away
into
the
river.
The
lure
landed
in
the
perfect
spot
and
he
was
sure
he
would
soon
get
a
bite.
He
never
expected
that
the
bite
would
come
from
behind
in
the
form
of
a
bear.
Mary
had
to
make
a
decision
and
she
knew
that
whatever
decision
she
made,
it
would
upset
someone.
It
seemed
like
such
a
silly
reason
for
people
to
get
upset
but
she
knew
the
minute
that
she
began
to
consider
doing
it
that
there
was
no
way
everyone
in
her
life
would
be
pleased
with
what
she
ultimately
decided
to
do.
It
was
simply
a
question
of
who
she
would
rather
displease
most.
While
this
had
always
been
her
parents,
and
especially
her
mom,
in
the
past
that
she
tried
to
keep
from
upsetting,
she
decided
that
this
time
the
person
she
was
going
to
please
the
most
with
her
decision
was
herself.
Her
hair
was
a
tangled
mess
which
she
tried
to
make
presentable
by
putting
in
a
lump
on
the
top
of
her
head.
It
didn't
really
work
although
it
was
a
valiant
attempt.
While
most
people
simply
noticed
the
tangled
mess
on
top
of
her
head,
what
most
people
failed
to
understand
that
within
the
tangles
mess
was
an
entirely
new
year.
That
was
her
secret.
She
kept
worlds
on
top
of
her
head.
Another
option
you
have
is
choosing
the
number
of
syllables
in
the
words
you
speak.
You
probably
have
never
considered
this
option
before,
but
you
have
it
every
time
you
open
your
mouth
and
speak.
You
make
so
many
choices
like
this
that
you
never
even
think
about,
but
you
have
the
choice
with
each
one.
What
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
knowledge?
She
tried
to
explain
that
love
wasn't
like
pie.
There
wasn't
a
set
number
of
slices
to
be
given
out.
There
wasn't
less
to
be
given
to
one
person
if
you
wanted
to
give
more
to
another.
That
after
a
set
amount
was
given
out
it
would
all
disappear.
She
tried
to
explain
this,
but
it
fell
on
deaf
ears.
Love
isn't
always
a
ray
of
sunshine.
That's
what
the
older
girls
kept
telling
her
when
she
said
she
had
found
the
perfect
man.
She
had
thought
this
was
simply
bitter
talk
on
their
part
since
they
had
been
unable
to
find
true
love
like
hers.
But
now
she
had
to
face
the
fact
that
they
may
have
been
right.
Love
may
not
always
be
a
ray
of
sunshine.
That
is
unless
they
were
referring
to
how
the
sun
can
burn.
She
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
could
tell
a
lot
about
a
person
by
their
ears.
The
way
they
stuck
out
and
the
size
of
the
earlobes
could
give
you
wonderful
insights
into
the
person.
Of
course,
she
couldn't
scientifically
prove
any
of
this,
but
that
didn't
matter
to
her.
Before
anything
else,
she
would
size
up
the
ears
of
the
person
she
was
talking
to.
There
were
two
things
that
were
important
to
Tracey.
The
first
was
her
dog.
Anyone
that
had
ever
met
Tracey
knew
how
much
she
loved
her
dog.
Most
would
say
that
she
treated
it
as
her
child.
The
dog
went
everywhere
with
her
and
it
had
been
her
best
friend
for
the
past
five
years.
The
second
thing
that
was
important
to
Tracey,
however,
would
be
a
lot
more
surprising
to
most
people.
With
six
children
in
tow,
Catherine
raced
to
the
airport
departing
gate.
This
wasn't
an
easy
task
as
the
children
had
other
priorities
than
to
get
to
the
gate.
She
knew
that
she
was
tight
on
time
and
the
frustration
came
out
as
she
yelled
at
the
kids
to
keep
up.
They
continued
to
test
her,
pretending
not
to
listen
and
to
move
in
directions
that
only
slowed
them
down.
They
had
no
idea
the
wrath
they
were
about
to
receive
when
Catherine
made
it
to
the
gate
only
to
be
informed
that
they
had
all
missed
the
plane.
The
computer
wouldn't
start.
She
banged
on
the
side
and
tried
again.
Nothing.
She
lifted
it
up
and
dropped
it
to
the
table.
Still
nothing.
She
banged
her
closed
fist
against
the
top.
It
was
at
this
moment
she
saw
the
irony
of
trying
to
fix
the
machine
with
violence.
Debbie
put
her
hand
into
the
hole,
sliding
her
hand
down
as
far
as
her
arm
could
reach.
She
wiggled
her
fingers
hoping
to
touch
something,
but
all
she
felt
was
air.
She
shifted
the
weight
of
her
body
to
try
and
reach
an
inch
or
two
more
down
the
hole.
Her
fingers
still
touched
nothing
but
air.
"It
doesn't
take
much
to
touch
someone's
heart,"
Daisy
said
with
a
smile
on
her
face.
"It's
often
just
the
little
things
you
do
that
can
change
a
person's
day
for
the
better."
Daisy
truly
believed
this
to
be
the
way
the
world
worked,
but
she
didn't
understand
that
she
was
merely
a
robot
that
had
been
programmed
to
believe
this.
I
checked
in
for
the
night
at
Out
O
The
Way
motel.
What
a
bad
choice
that
was.
First
I
took
a
shower
and
a
spider
crawled
out
of
the
drain.
Next,
the
towel
rack
fell
down
when
I
reached
for
the
one
small
bath
towel.
This
allowed
the
towel
to
fall
halfway
into
the
toilet.
I
tried
to
watch
a
movie,
but
the
remote
control
was
sticky
and
wouldn’t
stop
scrolling
through
the
channels.
I
gave
up
for
the
night
and
crawled
into
bed.
I
stretched
out
my
leg
and
felt
something
furry
by
my
foot.
Filled
with
fear,
I
reached
down
and
to
my
surprise,
I
pulled
out
a
raccoon
skin
pair
of
underwear.
After
my
initial
relief
that
it
wasn’t
alive,
the
image
of
a
fat,
ugly
businessman
wearing
raccoon
skin
briefs
filled
my
brain.
I
jumped
out
of
the
bed,
threw
my
toothbrush
into
my
bag,
and
sprinted
towards
my
car.
The
bridge
spanning
a
100-foot
gully
stood
in
front
of
him
as
the
last
obstacle
blocking
him
from
reaching
his
destination.
While
people
may
have
called
it
a
"bridge",
the
reality
was
it
was
nothing
more
than
splintered
wooden
planks
held
together
by
rotting
ropes.
It
was
questionable
whether
it
would
hold
the
weight
of
a
child,
let
alone
the
weight
of
a
grown
man.
The
problem
was
there
was
no
other
way
across
the
gully,
and
this
played
into
his
calculations
of
whether
or
not
it
was
worth
the
risk
of
trying
to
cross
it.
She
sat
in
the
darkened
room
waiting.
It
was
now
a
standoff.
He
had
the
power
to
put
her
in
the
room,
but
not
the
power
to
make
her
repent.
It
wasn't
fair
and
no
matter
how
long
she
had
to
endure
the
darkness,
she
wouldn't
change
her
attitude.
At
three
years
old,
Sandy's
stubborn
personality
had
already
bloomed
into
full
view.
At
that
moment
he
had
a
thought
that
he'd
never
imagine
he'd
consider.
"I
could
just
cheat,"
he
thought,
"and
that
would
solve
the
problem."
He
tried
to
move
on
from
the
thought
but
it
was
persistent.
It
didn't
want
to
go
away
and,
if
he
was
honest
with
himself,
he
didn't
want
it
to.
He
had
disappointed
himself
more
than
anyone
else.
That
wasn't
to
say
that
he
hadn't
disappointed
others.
The
fact
was
that
he
had
disappointed
a
lot
of
people
who
were
close
to
him.
The
fact
that
they
were
disappointed
in
him
was
something
that
made
him
even
more
disappointed
in
himself.
Yet
here
he
was,
about
to
do
the
exact
same
things
that
had
caused
all
the
disappointment
in
the
first
place
because
he
didn't
know
what
else
to
do.
They
had
always
called
it
the
green
river.
It
made
sense.
The
river
was
green.
The
river
likely
had
a
different
official
name,
but
to
everyone
in
town,
it
was
and
had
always
been
the
green
river.
So
it
was
with
great
surprise
that
on
this
day
the
green
river
was
a
fluorescent
pink.
There
was
a
time
when
he
would
have
embraced
the
change
that
was
coming.
In
his
youth,
he
sought
adventure
and
the
unknown,
but
that
had
been
years
ago.
He
wished
he
could
go
back
and
learn
to
find
the
excitement
that
came
with
change
but
it
was
useless.
That
curiosity
had
long
left
him
to
where
he
had
come
to
loathe
anything
that
put
him
out
of
his
comfort
zone.
Betty
decided
to
write
a
short
story
and
she
was
sure
it
was
going
to
be
amazing.
She
had
already
written
it
in
her
head
and
each
time
she
thought
about
it
she
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
knowing
how
wonderful
it
would
be.
She
could
imagine
the
accolades
coming
in
and
the
praise
she
would
receive
for
creating
such
a
wonderful
piece.
She
was
therefore
extremely
frustrated
when
she
actually
sat
down
to
write
the
short
story
and
the
story
that
was
so
beautiful
inside
her
head
refused
to
come
out
that
way
on
paper.
The
amber
droplet
hung
from
the
branch,
reaching
fullness
and
ready
to
drop.
It
waited.
While
many
of
the
other
droplets
were
satisfied
to
form
as
big
as
they
could
and
release,
this
droplet
had
other
plans.
It
wanted
to
be
part
of
history.
It
wanted
to
be
remembered
long
after
all
the
other
droplets
had
dissolved
into
history.
So
it
waited
for
the
perfect
specimen
to
fly
by
to
trap
and
capture
that
it
hoped
would
eventually
be
discovered
hundreds
of
years
in
the
future.
You
can
decide
what
you
want
to
do
in
life,
but
I
suggest
doing
something
that
creates.
Something
that
leaves
a
tangible
thing
once
you're
done.
That
way
even
after
you're
gone,
you
will
still
live
on
in
the
things
you
created.
There
was
something
beautiful
in
his
hate.
It
wasn't
the
hate
itself
as
it
was
a
disgusting
display
of
racism
and
intolerance.
It
was
what
propelled
the
hate
and
the
fact
that
although
he
had
this
hate,
he
didn't
understand
where
it
came
from.
It
was
at
that
moment
that
she
realized
that
there
was
hope
in
changing
him.
It
was
difficult
for
him
to
admit
he
was
wrong.
He
had
been
so
certain
that
he
was
correct
and
the
deeply
held
belief
could
never
be
shaken.
Yet
the
proof
that
he
had
been
incorrect
stood
right
before
his
eyes.
"See
daddy,
I
told
you
that
they
are
real!"
his
daughter
excitedly
proclaimed.
It
all
started
with
a
random
letter.
Several
of
those
were
joined
forces
to
create
a
random
word.
The
words
decided
to
get
together
and
form
a
random
sentence.
They
decided
not
to
stop
there
and
it
wasn't
long
before
a
random
paragraph
had
been
cobbled
together.
The
question
was
whether
or
not
they
could
continue
the
momentum
long
enough
to
create
a
random
short
story.
Finding
the
truth
wouldn't
be
easy,
that's
for
sure.
Then
there
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
Jane
really
wanted
to
know
the
truth.
That's
the
thing
that
bothered
her
most.
It
wasn't
the
difficulty
of
actually
finding
out
what
happened
that
was
the
obstacle,
but
having
to
live
with
that
information
once
it
was
found.
The
young
man
wanted
a
role
model.
He
looked
long
and
hard
in
his
youth,
but
that
role
model
never
materialized.
His
only
choice
was
to
embrace
all
the
people
in
his
life
he
didn't
want
to
be
like.
The
trail
to
the
left
had
a
"Danger!
Do
Not
Pass"
sign
telling
people
to
take
the
trail
to
the
right.
This
wasn't
the
way
Zeke
approached
his
hiking.
Rather
than
a
warning,
Zeke
read
the
sign
as
an
invitation
to
explore
an
area
that
would
be
adventurous
and
exciting.
As
the
others
in
the
group
all
shited
to
the
right,
Zeke
slipped
past
the
danger
sign
to
begin
an
adventure
he
would
later
regret.
There
were
a
variety
of
ways
to
win
the
game.
James
had
played
it
long
enough
to
know
most
of
them
and
he
could
see
what
his
opponent
was
trying
to
do.
There
was
a
simple
counterattack
that
James
could
use
and
the
game
should
be
his.
He
began
deploying
it
with
the
confidence
of
a
veteran
player
who
had
been
in
this
situation
a
thousand
times
in
the
past.
So,
it
was
with
great
surprise
when
his
opponent
used
a
move
he
had
never
before
seen
or
anticipated
to
easily
defeat
him
in
the
game.
Patrick
didn't
want
to
go.
The
fact
that
she
was
insisting
they
must
go
made
him
want
to
go
even
less.
He
had
no
desire
to
make
small
talk
with
strangers
he
would
never
again
see
just
to
be
polite.
But
she
insisted
that
Patrick
go,
and
she
would
soon
find
out
that
this
would
be
the
biggest
mistake
she
could
make
in
their
relationship.
Debbie
knew
she
was
being
selfish
and
unreasonable.
She
understood
why
the
others
in
the
room
were
angry
and
frustrated
with
her
and
the
way
she
was
acting.
In
her
eyes,
it
didn't
really
matter
how
they
felt
because
she
simply
didn't
care.
The
bush
began
to
shake.
Brad
couldn't
see
what
was
causing
it
to
shake,
but
he
didn't
care.
he
had
a
pretty
good
idea
about
what
was
going
on
and
what
was
happening.
He
was
so
confident
that
he
approached
the
bush
carefree
and
with
a
smile
on
his
face.
That
all
changed
the
instant
he
realized
what
was
actually
behind
the
bush.
There
were
little
things
that
she
simply
could
not
stand.
The
sound
of
someone
tapping
their
nails
on
the
table.
A
person
chewing
with
their
mouth
open.
Another
human
imposing
themselves
into
her
space.
She
couldn't
stand
any
of
these
things,
but
none
of
them
compared
to
the
number
one
thing
she
couldn't
stand
which
topped
all
of
them
combined.
The
red
line
moved
across
the
page.
With
each
millimeter
it
advanced
forward,
something
changed
in
the
room.
The
actual
change
taking
place
was
difficult
to
perceive,
but
the
change
was
real.
The
red
line
continued
relentlessly
across
the
page
and
the
room
would
never
be
the
same.
Samantha
wanted
to
be
famous.
The
problem
was
that
she
had
never
considered
all
the
downsides
to
actually
being
famous.
Had
she
taken
the
time
to
objectively
consider
these
downsides,
she
would
have
never
agreed
to
publically
sing
that
first
song.
Hopes
and
dreams
were
dashed
that
day.
It
should
have
been
expected,
but
it
still
came
as
a
shock.
The
warning
signs
had
been
ignored
in
favor
of
the
possibility,
however
remote,
that
it
could
actually
happen.
That
possibility
had
grown
from
hope
to
an
undeniable
belief
it
must
be
destiny.
That
was
until
it
wasn't
and
the
hopes
and
dreams
came
crashing
down.
According
to
the
caption
on
the
bronze
marker
placed
by
the
Multnomah
Chapter
of
the
Daughters
of
the
American
Revolution
on
May
12,
1939,
“College
Hall
(is)
the
oldest
building
in
continuous
use
for
Educational
purposes
west
of
the
Rocky
Mountains.
Here
were
educated
men
and
women
who
have
won
recognition
throughout
the
world
in
all
the
learned
professions.”
She
didn't
understand
how
changed
worked.
When
she
looked
at
today
compared
to
yesterday,
there
was
nothing
that
she
could
see
that
was
different.
Yet,
when
she
looked
at
today
compared
to
last
year,
she
couldn't
see
how
anything
was
ever
the
same.
He
picked
up
the
burnt
end
of
the
branch
and
made
a
mark
on
the
stone.
Day
52
if
the
marks
on
the
stone
were
accurate.
He
couldn't
be
sure.
Day
and
nights
had
begun
to
blend
together
creating
confusion,
but
he
knew
it
was
a
long
time.
Much
too
long.
Nobody
really
understood
Kevin.
It
wasn't
that
he
was
super
strange
or
difficult.
It
was
more
that
there
wasn't
enough
there
that
anyone
wanted
to
take
the
time
to
understand
him.
This
was
a
shame
as
Kevin
had
many
of
the
answers
to
the
important
questions
most
people
who
knew
him
had.
It
was
even
more
of
a
shame
that
they'd
refuse
to
listen
even
if
Kevin
offered
to
give
them
the
answers.
So,
Kevin
remained
silent,
misunderstood,
and
kept
those
important
answers
to
life
to
himself.
There
once
lived
an
old
man
and
an
old
woman
who
were
peasants
and
had
to
work
hard
to
earn
their
daily
bread.
The
old
man
used
to
go
to
fix
fences
and
do
other
odd
jobs
for
the
farmers
around,
and
while
he
was
gone
the
old
woman,
his
wife,
did
the
work
of
the
house
and
worked
in
their
own
little
plot
of
land.
I
inadvertently
went
to
See's
Candy
last
week
(I
was
in
the
mall
looking
for
phone
repair),
and
as
it
turns
out,
See's
Candy
now
charges
a
dollar
--
a
full
dollar
--
for
even
the
simplest
of
their
wee
confection
offerings.
I
bought
two
chocolate
lollipops
and
two
chocolate-caramel-almond
things.
The
total
cost
was
four-something.
I
mean,
the
candies
were
tasty
and
all,
but
let's
be
real:
A
Snickers
bar
is
fifty
cents.
After
this
dollar-per-candy
revelation,
I
may
not
find
myself
wandering
dreamily
back
into
a
See's
Candy
any
time
soon.
Her
mom
had
warned
her.
She
had
been
warned
time
and
again,
but
she
had
refused
to
believe
her.
She
had
done
everything
right
and
she
knew
she
would
be
rewarded
for
doing
so
with
the
promotion.
So
when
the
promotion
was
given
to
her
main
rival,
it
not
only
stung,
it
threw
her
belief
system
into
disarray.
It
was
her
first
big
lesson
in
life,
but
not
the
last.
The
bridge
spanning
a
100-foot
gully
stood
in
front
of
him
as
the
last
obstacle
blocking
him
from
reaching
his
destination.
While
people
may
have
called
it
a
"bridge",
the
reality
was
it
was
nothing
more
than
splintered
wooden
planks
held
together
by
rotting
ropes.
It
was
questionable
whether
it
would
hold
the
weight
of
a
child,
let
alone
the
weight
of
a
grown
man.
The
problem
was
there
was
no
other
way
across
the
gully,
and
this
played
into
his
calculations
of
whether
or
not
it
was
worth
the
risk
of
trying
to
cross
it.
The
words
hadn't
flowed
from
his
fingers
for
the
past
few
weeks.
He
never
imagined
he'd
find
himself
with
writer's
block,
but
here
he
sat
with
a
blank
screen
in
front
of
him.
That
blank
screen
taunting
him
day
after
day
had
started
to
play
with
his
mind.
He
didn't
understand
why
he
couldn't
even
type
a
single
word,
just
one
to
begin
the
process
and
build
from
there.
And
yet,
he
already
knew
that
the
eight
hours
he
was
prepared
to
sit
in
front
of
his
computer
today
would
end
with
the
screen
remaining
blank.
She
reached
her
goal,
exhausted.
Even
more
chilling
to
her
was
that
the
euphoria
that
she
thought
she'd
feel
upon
reaching
it
wasn't
there.
Something
wasn't
right.
Was
this
the
only
feeling
she'd
have
for
over
five
years
of
hard
work?
She
didn't
like
the
food.
She
never
did.
She
made
the
usual
complaints
and
started
the
tantrum
he
knew
was
coming.
But
this
time
was
different.
Instead
of
trying
to
placate
her
and
her
unreasonable
demands,
he
just
stared
at
her
and
watched
her
meltdown
without
saying
a
word.
Stormi
is
a
dog.
She
is
dark
grey
and
has
long
legs.
Her
eyes
are
expressive
and
are
able
to
let
her
humans
know
what
she
is
thinking.
Her
tongue
is
long,
pink,
and
wet.
Her
long
legs
allow
her
to
sprint
after
other
dogs,
people
or
bunnies.
She
can
be
a
good
dog,
but
also
very
bad.
Her
tail
wags
when
happy
or
excited
and
hides
between
her
back
legs
when
she
is
bad.
Stormi
is
a
dog
I
love.
The
answer
was
within
her
reach.
It
was
hidden
in
a
box
and
now
that
box
sat
directly
in
front
of
her.
She'd
spent
years
searching
for
it
and
could
hardly
believe
she'd
finally
managed
to
find
it.
She
turned
the
key
to
unlock
the
box
and
then
gently
lifted
the
top.
She
held
her
breath
in
anticipation
of
finally
knowing
the
answer
she
had
spent
so
much
of
her
time
in
search
of.
As
the
lid
came
off
she
could
see
that
the
box
was
empty.
Waiting
and
watching.
It
was
all
she
had
done
for
the
past
weeks.
When
you’re
locked
in
a
room
with
nothing
but
food
and
drink,
that’s
about
all
you
can
do
anyway.
She
watched
as
birds
flew
past
the
window
bolted
shut.
She
couldn’t
reach
it
if
she
wanted
too,
with
that
hole
in
the
floor.
She
thought
she
could
escape
through
it
but
three
stories
is
a
bit
far
down.
Twenty
seconds
were
all
that
was
left
and
Richard
could
hear
each
one
tick
by.
Fifteen
seconds
now
remained
and
the
panic
began
to
fully
set
in.
Ten
seconds
and
he
wasn't
sure
he
had
enough
time.
Five
seconds,
four,
three,
two,
one...
It
was
difficult
to
explain
to
them
how
the
diagnosis
of
certain
death
had
actually
given
him
life.
While
everyone
around
him
was
in
tears
and
upset,
he
actually
felt
more
at
ease.
The
doctor
said
it
would
be
less
than
a
year.
That
gave
him
a
year
to
live,
something
he'd
failed
to
do
with
his
daily
drudgery
of
a
routine
that
had
passed
as
life
until
then.
Sometimes
it's
the
first
moment
of
the
day
that
catches
you
off
guard.
That's
what
Wendy
was
thinking.
She
opened
her
window
to
see
fire
engines
screeching
down
the
street.
While
this
wasn't
something
completely
unheard
of,
it
also
wasn't
normal.
It
was
a
sure
sign
of
what
was
going
to
happen
that
day.
She
could
feel
it
in
her
bones
and
it
wasn't
the
way
she
wanted
the
day
to
begin.
Sitting
in
the
sun,
away
from
everyone
who
had
done
him
harm
in
the
past,
he
quietly
listened
to
those
who
roamed
by.
He
felt
at
peace
in
the
moment,
hoping
it
would
last,
but
knowing
the
reprieve
would
soon
come
to
an
end.
He
closed
his
eyes,
the
sun
beating
down
on
face
and
he
smiled.
He
smiled
for
the
first
time
in
as
long
as
he
could
remember.
My
pincher
collar
is
snapped
on.
Then
comes
the
electric
zapper
collar.
Finally,
my
purple
at-home
collar
is
taken
off
and
I
know
I’m
going
for
a
walk
to
the
dog
park.
I’m
so
excited
to
see
my
friends.
I
hope
Spike
or
Thunder
are
there
already.
They're
the
most
fun
to
chase
and
tumble
with.
My
human
is
pretty
strict
with
me.
I’m
only
allowed
on
the
grass
and
not
on
the
sidewalks.
I
think
she’s
afraid
I’m
going
to
jump
on
the
other
humans.
I
don’t
understand
why
everyone
else
gets
to
jump
on
the
benches
and
run
wild
on
the
sidewalks.
They
don’t
listen
to
their
humans.
I
know
I
could
ignore
mine
but
if
I
do
she
may
zap
me
and
it’s
just
not
worth
it.
She
probably
wouldn’t
let
me
back
at
the
dog
park
if
I
didn’t
listen
to
her.
I
just
love
the
dog
park.
She
was
infatuated
with
color.
She
didn't
have
a
favorite
color
per
se,
but
she
did
have
a
fondness
for
teals
and
sea
greens.
You
could
see
it
in
the
clothes
she
wore
that
color
was
an
important
part
of
her
overall
style.
She
took
great
pride
that
color
flowed
from
her
and
that
color
was
always
all
around
her.
That
is
why,
she
explained
to
her
date
sitting
across
the
table,
that
she
could
never
have
a
serious
relationship
with
him
due
to
the
fact
that
he
was
colorblind.
Then
came
the
night
of
the
first
falling
star.
It
was
seen
early
in
the
morning,
rushing
over
Winchester
eastward,
a
line
of
flame
high
in
the
atmosphere.
Hundreds
must
have
seen
it
and
taken
it
for
an
ordinary
falling
star.
It
seemed
that
it
fell
to
earth
about
one
hundred
miles
east
of
him.
The
choice
was
red,
green,
or
blue.
It
didn't
seem
like
an
important
choice
when
he
was
making
it,
but
it
was
a
choice
nonetheless.
Had
he
known
the
consequences
at
that
time,
he
would
likely
have
considered
the
choice
a
bit
longer.
In
the
end,
he
didn't
and
ended
up
choosing
blue.
The
picket
fence
had
stood
for
years
without
any
issue.
That's
all
it
was.
A
simple,
white,
picket
fence.
Why
it
had
all
of
a
sudden
become
a
lightning
rod
within
the
community
was
still
unbelievable
to
most.
Yet
a
community
that
had
once
lived
in
harmony
was
now
divided
in
bitter
hatred
and
it
had
everything
to
do
with
the
white
picket
fence.
The
wave
crashed
and
hit
the
sandcastle
head-on.
The
sandcastle
began
to
melt
under
the
waves
force
and
as
the
wave
receded,
half
the
sandcastle
was
gone.
The
next
wave
hit,
not
quite
as
strong,
but
still
managed
to
cover
the
remains
of
the
sandcastle
and
take
more
of
it
away.
The
third
wave,
a
big
one,
crashed
over
the
sandcastle
completely
covering
and
engulfing
it.
When
it
receded,
there
was
no
trace
the
sandcastle
ever
existed
and
hours
of
hard
work
disappeared
forever.
The
song
came
from
the
bathroom
belting
over
the
sound
of
the
shower's
running
water.
It
was
the
same
way
each
day
began
since
he
could
remember.
It
listened
intently
and
concluded
that
the
singing
today
was
as
terrible
as
it
had
ever
been.
He
was
after
the
truth.
At
least,
that's
what
he
told
himself.
He
believed
it,
but
any
rational
person
on
the
outside
could
see
he
was
lying
to
himself.
It
was
apparent
he
was
really
only
after
his
own
truth
that
he'd
already
decided
and
was
after
this
truth
because
the
facts
didn't
line
up
with
the
truth
he
wanted.
So
he
continued
to
tell
everyone
he
was
after
the
truth
oblivious
to
the
real
truth
sitting
right
in
front
of
him.
Barbara
had
been
waiting
at
the
table
for
twenty
minutes.
it
had
been
twenty
long
and
excruciating
minutes.
David
had
promised
that
he
would
be
on
time
today.
He
never
was,
but
he
had
promised
this
one
time.
She
had
made
him
repeat
the
promise
multiple
times
over
the
last
week
until
she'd
believed
his
promise.
Now
she
was
paying
the
price.
He
knew
what
he
was
supposed
to
do.
That
had
been
apparent
from
the
beginning.
That
was
what
made
the
choice
so
difficult.
What
he
was
supposed
to
do
and
what
he
would
do
were
not
the
same.
This
would
have
been
fine
if
he
were
willing
to
face
the
inevitable
consequences,
but
he
wasn't.
It
wasn't
that
he
hated
her.
It
was
simply
that
he
didn't
like
her
much.
It
was
difficult
for
him
to
explain
this
to
her,
and
even
more
difficult
for
her
to
truly
understand.
She
was
in
love
and
wanted
him
to
feel
the
same
way.
He
didn't,
and
no
matter
how
he
tried
to
explain
to
her
she
refused
to
listen
or
to
understand.
There
was
only
one
way
to
do
things
in
the
Statton
house.
That
one
way
was
to
do
exactly
what
the
father,
Charlie,
demanded.
He
made
the
decisions
and
everyone
else
followed
without
question.
That
was
until
today.
He
couldn't
move.
His
head
throbbed
and
spun.
He
couldn't
decide
if
it
was
the
flu
or
the
drinking
last
night.
It
was
probably
a
combination
of
both.
Sleeping
in
his
car
was
never
the
plan
but
sometimes
things
don't
work
out
as
planned.
This
had
been
his
life
for
the
last
three
months
and
he
was
just
beginning
to
get
used
to
it.
He
didn't
actually
enjoy
it,
but
he
had
accepted
it
and
come
to
terms
with
it.
Or
at
least
he
thought
he
had.
All
that
changed
when
he
put
the
key
into
the
ignition,
turned
it
and
the
engine
didn't
make
a
sound.
The
headache
wouldn't
go
away.
She's
taken
medicine
but
even
that
didn't
help.
The
monstrous
throbbing
in
her
head
continued.
She
had
this
happen
to
her
only
once
before
in
her
life
and
she
realized
that
only
one
thing
could
be
happening.
She
tried
to
explain
that
love
wasn't
like
pie.
There
wasn't
a
set
number
of
slices
to
be
given
out.
There
wasn't
less
to
be
given
to
one
person
if
you
wanted
to
give
more
to
another.
That
after
a
set
amount
was
given
out
it
would
all
disappear.
She
tried
to
explain
this,
but
it
fell
on
deaf
ears.
Sometimes
there
isn't
a
good
answer.
No
matter
how
you
try
to
rationalize
the
outcome,
it
doesn't
make
sense.
And
instead
of
an
answer,
you
are
simply
left
with
a
question.
Why?
It
was
a
simple
tip
of
the
hat.
Grace
didn't
think
that
anyone
else
besides
her
had
even
noticed
it.
It
wasn't
anything
that
the
average
person
would
notice,
let
alone
remember
at
the
end
of
the
day.
That's
why
it
seemed
so
unbelievable
that
this
little
gesture
would
ultimately
change
the
course
of
the
world.
He
slowly
poured
the
drink
over
a
large
chunk
of
ice
he
has
especially
chiseled
off
a
larger
block.
He
didn't
particularly
like
his
drinks
cold,
but
he
knew
that
the
drama
of
chiseling
the
ice
and
then
pouring
a
drink
over
it
looked
far
more
impressive
than
how
he
actually
liked
it.
It
was
all
about
image
and
he'd
managed
to
perfect
the
image
that
he
wanted
to
project.
It
was
just
a
burger.
Why
couldn't
she
understand
that?
She
knew
he'd
completely
changed
his
life
around
her
eating
habits,
so
why
couldn't
she
give
him
a
break
this
one
time?
She
wasn't
even
supposed
to
have
found
out.
Yes,
he
had
promised
her
and
yes,
he
had
broken
that
promise,
but
still
in
his
mind,
all
it
had
been
was
just
a
burger.
One
can
cook
on
and
with
an
open
fire.
These
are
some
of
the
ways
to
cook
with
fire
outside.
Cooking
meat
using
a
spit
is
a
great
way
to
evenly
cook
meat.
In
order
to
keep
meat
from
burning,
it's
best
to
slowly
rotate
it.
Hot
stones
can
be
used
to
toast
bread.
Coals
are
hot
and
can
bring
things
to
a
boil
quickly.
If
one
is
very
adventurous,
one
can
make
a
hole
in
the
ground,
fill
it
with
coals
and
place
foil-covered
meat,
veggies,
and
potatoes
into
the
coals,
and
cover
all
of
it
with
dirt.
In
a
short
period
of
time,
the
food
will
be
baked.
Campfire
cooking
can
be
done
in
many
ways.
He
heard
the
crack
echo
in
the
late
afternoon
about
a
mile
away.
His
heart
started
racing
and
he
bolted
into
a
full
sprint.
"It
wasn't
a
gunshot,
it
wasn't
a
gunshot,"
he
repeated
under
his
breathlessness
as
he
continued
to
sprint.
If
you
can
imagine
a
furry
humanoid
seven
feet
tall,
with
the
face
of
an
intelligent
gorilla
and
the
braincase
of
a
man,
you'll
have
a
rough
idea
of
what
they
looked
like
--
except
for
their
teeth.
The
canines
would
have
fitted
better
in
the
face
of
a
tiger,
and
showed
at
the
corners
of
their
wide,
thin-lipped
mouths,
giving
them
an
expression
of
ferocity.
What
have
you
noticed
today?
I
noticed
that
if
you
outline
the
eyes,
nose,
and
mouth
on
your
face
with
your
finger,
you
make
an
"I"
which
makes
perfect
sense,
but
is
something
I
never
noticed
before.
What
have
you
noticed
today?
The
coin
hovered
in
the
air,
spinning
over
and
over
again.
It
reached
its
peak
and
began
to
descend.
Both
boys
were
pleading
with
it
to
land
a
certain
way
but
the
coin
had
already
made
up
its
mind
on
what
it
was
going
to
do.
Sometimes
it
just
doesn't
make
sense.
The
man
walking
down
the
street
in
a
banana
suit.
The
llama
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road.
The
fairies
dancing
in
front
of
the
car
window.
The
fact
that
all
of
this
was
actually
happening
and
wasn't
a
dream.
What
were
they
eating?
It
didn't
taste
like
anything
she
had
ever
eaten
before
and
although
she
was
famished,
she
didn't
dare
ask.
She
knew
the
answer
would
be
one
she
didn't
want
to
hear.
He
had
done
everything
right.
There
had
been
no
mistakes
throughout
the
entire
process.
It
had
been
perfection
and
he
knew
it
without
a
doubt,
but
the
results
still
stared
back
at
him
with
the
fact
that
he
had
lost.
Devon
couldn't
figure
out
the
color
of
her
eyes.
He
initially
would
have
guessed
that
they
were
green,
but
the
more
he
looked
at
them
he
almost
wanted
to
say
they
were
a
golden
yellow.
Then
there
were
the
flashes
of
red
and
orange
that
seemed
to
be
streaked
throughout
them.
It
was
almost
as
if
her
eyes
were
made
of
opal
with
the
sun
constantly
glinting
off
of
them
and
bringing
out
more
color.
They
were
definitely
the
most
unusual
pair
of
eyes
he'd
ever
seen.
It
was
just
a
burger.
Why
couldn't
she
understand
that?
She
knew
he'd
completely
changed
his
life
around
her
eating
habits,
so
why
couldn't
she
give
him
a
break
this
one
time?
She
wasn't
even
supposed
to
have
found
out.
Yes,
he
had
promised
her
and
yes,
he
had
broken
that
promise,
but
still
in
his
mind,
all
it
had
been
was
just
a
burger.
What
were
the
chances?
It
would
have
to
be
a
lot
more
than
100
to
1.
It
was
likely
even
more
than
1,000
to
1.
The
more
he
thought
about
it,
the
odds
of
it
happening
had
to
be
more
than
10,000
to
1
and
even
100,000
to
1.
People
often
threw
around
the
chances
of
something
happening
as
being
1,000,000
to
1
as
an
exaggeration
of
an
unlikely
event,
but
he
could
see
that
they
may
actually
be
accurate
in
this
situation.
Whatever
the
odds
of
it
happening,
he
knew
they
were
big.
What
he
didn't
know
was
whether
this
happening
was
lucky
or
unlucky.
Barbara
had
been
waiting
at
the
table
for
twenty
minutes.
it
had
been
twenty
long
and
excruciating
minutes.
David
had
promised
that
he
would
be
on
time
today.
He
never
was,
but
he
had
promised
this
one
time.
She
had
made
him
repeat
the
promise
multiple
times
over
the
last
week
until
she'd
believed
his
promise.
Now
she
was
paying
the
price.
What
if
dogs
were
racist?
Would
they
care
about
fur
color…..
“son,
only
play
with
other
tan
dogs”?
Or
maybe
it
would
depend
on
breed,
“honey,
only
play
with
other
German
Shepards,
never
poodles”.
Better
yet
it
could
depend
on
occupation.
“I’m
a
sled
dog
while
you’re
only
a
running
companion,
leave
me
alone”.
Maybe
the
neighborhood
they
live
in
could
be
the
way
they
choose
which
dogs
to
associate
with
and
which
to
shun?
Size
could
be
the
determining
factor,
“see
how
tall
that
dog
is,
they
are
probably
dumb”.
Luckily
dogs
don’t
discriminate.
Just
watch
at
a
dog
park.
Big
black
and
white
dogs
wag
their
tails
and
play
with
tiny
tan
dogs.
A
service
dog
chases
after
the
same
ball
as
the
off-duty
police
dog.
So
if
dogs
don’t
discriminate
then
why
do
we?
He
slowly
poured
the
drink
over
a
large
chunk
of
ice
he
has
especially
chiseled
off
a
larger
block.
He
didn't
particularly
like
his
drinks
cold,
but
he
knew
that
the
drama
of
chiseling
the
ice
and
then
pouring
a
drink
over
it
looked
far
more
impressive
than
how
he
actually
liked
it.
It
was
all
about
image
and
he'd
managed
to
perfect
the
image
that
he
wanted
to
project.
Don't
forget
that
gifts
often
come
with
costs
that
go
beyond
their
purchase
price.
When
you
purchase
a
child
the
latest
smartphone,
you're
also
committing
to
a
monthly
phone
bill.
When
you
purchase
the
latest
gaming
system,
you're
likely
not
going
to
be
satisfied
with
the
games
that
come
with
it
for
long
and
want
to
purchase
new
titles
to
play.
When
you
buy
gifts
it's
important
to
remember
that
some
come
with
additional
costs
down
the
road
that
can
be
much
more
expensive
than
the
initial
gift
itself.
It
wasn't
supposed
to
end
that
way.
The
plan
had
been
meticulously
thought
out
and
practiced
again
and
again.
There
was
only
one
possible
result
once
it
had
been
implemented,
but
as
they
stood
there
the
result
wasn't
anything
close
to
what
it
should
have
been.
They
all
blankly
looked
at
each
wondering
how
this
could
have
happened.
In
their
minds,
they
all
began
to
blame
the
other
members
of
the
group
as
to
why
they
had
failed.
The
bowl
was
filled
with
fruit.
It
seemed
to
be
an
overabundance
of
strawberries,
but
it
also
included
blueberries,
raspberries,
grapes,
and
banana
slices.
This
was
the
meal
Sarah
had
every
morning
to
start
her
day
since
she
could
remember.
Why
she
decided
to
add
chocolate
as
an
option
today
was
still
a
bit
of
a
surprise,
but
she
had
been
in
the
process
of
deciding
she
wanted
to
change
her
routine.
This
was
a
baby
step
to
begin
that
start.
I
inadvertently
went
to
See's
Candy
last
week
(I
was
in
the
mall
looking
for
phone
repair),
and
as
it
turns
out,
See's
Candy
now
charges
a
dollar
--
a
full
dollar
--
for
even
the
simplest
of
their
wee
confection
offerings.
I
bought
two
chocolate
lollipops
and
two
chocolate-caramel-almond
things.
The
total
cost
was
four-something.
I
mean,
the
candies
were
tasty
and
all,
but
let's
be
real:
A
Snickers
bar
is
fifty
cents.
After
this
dollar-per-candy
revelation,
I
may
not
find
myself
wandering
dreamily
back
into
a
See's
Candy
any
time
soon.
The
amber
droplet
hung
from
the
branch,
reaching
fullness
and
ready
to
drop.
It
waited.
While
many
of
the
other
droplets
were
satisfied
to
form
as
big
as
they
could
and
release,
this
droplet
had
other
plans.
It
wanted
to
be
part
of
history.
It
wanted
to
be
remembered
long
after
all
the
other
droplets
had
dissolved
into
history.
So
it
waited
for
the
perfect
specimen
to
fly
by
to
trap
and
capture
that
it
hoped
would
eventually
be
discovered
hundreds
of
years
in
the
future.
There
was
something
in
the
tree.
It
was
difficult
to
tell
from
the
ground,
but
Rachael
could
see
movement.
She
squinted
her
eyes
and
peered
in
the
direction
of
the
movement,
trying
to
decipher
exactly
what
she
had
spied.
The
more
she
peered,
however,
the
more
she
thought
it
might
be
a
figment
of
her
imagination.
Nothing
seemed
to
move
until
the
moment
she
began
to
take
her
eyes
off
the
tree.
Then
in
the
corner
of
her
eye,
she
would
see
the
movement
again
and
begin
the
process
of
staring
again.
Don't
be
scared.
The
things
out
there
that
are
unknown
aren't
scary
in
themselves.
They
are
just
unknown
at
the
moment.
Take
the
time
to
know
them
before
you
list
them
as
scary.
Then
the
world
will
be
a
much
less
scary
place
for
you.
He
ordered
his
regular
breakfast.
Two
eggs
sunnyside
up,
hash
browns,
and
two
strips
of
bacon.
He
continued
to
look
at
the
menu
wondering
if
this
would
be
the
day
he
added
something
new.
This
was
also
part
of
the
routine.
A
few
seconds
of
hesitation
to
see
if
something
else
would
be
added
to
the
order
before
demuring
and
saying
that
would
be
all.
It
was
the
same
exact
meal
that
he
had
ordered
every
day
for
the
past
two
years.
There
are
only
three
ways
to
make
this
work.
The
first
is
to
let
me
take
care
of
everything.
The
second
is
for
you
to
take
care
of
everything.
The
third
is
to
split
everything
50
/
50.
I
think
the
last
option
is
the
most
preferable,
but
I'm
certain
it'll
also
mean
the
end
of
our
marriage.
The
thing
that's
great
about
this
job
is
the
time
sourcing
the
items
involves
no
traveling.
I
just
look
online
to
buy
it.
It's
really
as
simple
as
that.
While
everyone
else
is
searching
for
what
they
can
sell,
I
sit
in
front
of
my
computer
and
buy
better
stuff
for
less
money
and
spend
a
fraction
of
the
time
doing
it.
I
recollect
that
my
first
exploit
in
squirrel-shooting
was
in
a
grove
of
tall
walnut-trees
that
shades
one
side
of
the
valley.
I
had
wandered
into
it
at
noontime,
when
all
nature
is
peculiarly
quiet,
and
was
startled
by
the
roar
of
my
own
gun,
as
it
broke
the
Sabbath
stillness
around
and
was
prolonged
and
reverberated
by
the
angry
echoes.
The
wolves
stopped
in
their
tracks,
sizing
up
the
mother
and
her
cubs.
It
had
been
over
a
week
since
their
last
meal
and
they
were
getting
desperate.
The
cubs
would
make
a
good
meal,
but
there
were
high
risks
taking
on
the
mother
Grizzly.
A
decision
had
to
be
made
and
the
wrong
choice
could
signal
the
end
of
the
pack.
They
had
made
it
to
Las
Vegas,
wide-eyed
and
with
so
much
hope
and
energy.
They
had
planned
the
trip
for
more
than
a
year
and
both
were
so
excited
they
could
barely
control
themselves.
They
still
hadn't
realized
that
Las
Vegas
promised
a
place
where
dreams
come
true,
it
was
actually
the
place
where
dreams
came
to
die.
Twenty-five
stars
were
neatly
placed
on
the
piece
of
paper.
There
was
room
for
five
more
stars
but
they
would
be
difficult
ones
to
earn.
It
had
taken
years
to
earn
the
first
twenty-five,
and
they
were
considered
the
"easy"
ones.
I
recently
discovered
I
could
make
fudge
with
just
chocolate
chips,
sweetened
condensed
milk,
vanilla
extract,
and
a
thick
pot
on
slow
heat.
I
tried
it
with
dark
chocolate
chunks
and
I
tried
it
with
semi-sweet
chocolate
chips.
It's
better
with
both
kinds.
It
comes
out
pretty
bad
with
just
the
dark
chocolate.
The
best
add-ins
are
crushed
almonds
and
marshmallows
--
what
you
get
from
that
is
Rocky
Road.
It
takes
about
twenty
minutes
from
start
to
fridge,
and
then
it
takes
about
six
months
to
work
off
the
twenty
pounds
you
gain
from
eating
it.
All
things
in
moderation,
friends.
All
things
in
moderation.
There
was
only
one
way
to
do
things
in
the
Statton
house.
That
one
way
was
to
do
exactly
what
the
father,
Charlie,
demanded.
He
made
the
decisions
and
everyone
else
followed
without
question.
That
was
until
today.
The
answer
was
within
her
reach.
It
was
hidden
in
a
box
and
now
that
box
sat
directly
in
front
of
her.
She'd
spent
years
searching
for
it
and
could
hardly
believe
she'd
finally
managed
to
find
it.
She
turned
the
key
to
unlock
the
box
and
then
gently
lifted
the
top.
She
held
her
breath
in
anticipation
of
finally
knowing
the
answer
she
had
spent
so
much
of
her
time
in
search
of.
As
the
lid
came
off
she
could
see
that
the
box
was
empty.
There
was
nothing
to
indicate
Nancy
was
going
to
change
the
world.
She
looked
like
an
average
girl
going
to
an
average
high
school.
It
was
the
fact
that
everything
about
her
seemed
average
that
would
end
up
becoming
her
superpower.
She
was
aware
that
things
could
go
wrong.
In
fact,
she
had
trained
her
entire
life
in
anticipation
that
things
would
go
wrong
one
day.
She
had
quiet
confidence
as
she
started
to
see
that
this
was
the
day
that
all
her
training
would
be
worthwhile
and
useful.
At
this
point,
she
had
no
idea
just
how
wrong
everything
would
go
that
day.
The
desert
wind
blew
the
tumbleweed
in
front
of
the
car.
Alex
swerved
to
avoid
the
tumbleweed,
but
he
turned
the
wheel
a
bit
too
strong
and
the
car
left
the
road
and
skidded
onto
the
dirt
median.
He
instantly
slammed
on
the
brakes
and
the
car
stopped
in
a
cloud
of
dirt.
When
the
dust
cloud
had
settled
and
he
could
see
around
him
again,
he
realized
that
he'd
somehow
crossed
over
into
an
entirely
new
dimension.
She
has
seen
this
scene
before.
It
had
come
to
her
in
dreams
many
times
before.
She
had
to
pinch
herself
to
make
sure
it
wasn't
a
dream
again.
As
her
fingers
squeezed
against
her
arm,
she
felt
the
pain.
It
was
this
pain
that
immediately
woke
her
up.
He
had
done
everything
right.
There
had
been
no
mistakes
throughout
the
entire
process.
It
had
been
perfection
and
he
knew
it
without
a
doubt,
but
the
results
still
stared
back
at
him
with
the
fact
that
he
had
lost.
He
wandered
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
basement.
The
damp,
musty
smell
of
unuse
hung
in
the
air.
A
single,
small
window
let
in
a
glimmer
of
light,
but
this
simply
made
the
shadows
in
the
basement
deeper.
He
inhaled
deeply
and
looked
around
at
a
mess
that
had
been
accumulating
for
over
25
years.
He
was
positive
that
this
was
the
place
he
wanted
to
live.
Sleeping
in
his
car
was
never
the
plan
but
sometimes
things
don't
work
out
as
planned.
This
had
been
his
life
for
the
last
three
months
and
he
was
just
beginning
to
get
used
to
it.
He
didn't
actually
enjoy
it,
but
he
had
accepted
it
and
come
to
terms
with
it.
Or
at
least
he
thought
he
had.
All
that
changed
when
he
put
the
key
into
the
ignition,
turned
it
and
the
engine
didn't
make
a
sound.
The
blinking
light
caught
her
attention.
She
thought
about
it
a
bit
and
couldn't
remember
ever
noticing
it
before.
That
was
strange
since
it
was
obvious
the
flashing
light
had
been
there
for
years.
Now
she
wondered
how
she
missed
it
for
that
amount
of
time
and
what
other
things
in
her
small
town
she
had
failed
to
notice.
The
cab
arrived
late.
The
inside
was
in
as
bad
of
shape
as
the
outside
which
was
concerning,
and
it
didn't
appear
that
it
had
been
cleaned
in
months.
The
green
tree
air-freshener
hanging
from
the
rearview
mirror
was
either
exhausted
of
its
scent
or
not
strong
enough
to
overcome
the
other
odors
emitting
from
the
cab.
The
correct
decision,
in
this
case,
was
to
get
the
hell
out
of
it
and
to
call
another
cab,
but
she
was
late
and
didn't
have
a
choice.
They
argue.
While
the
argument
seems
to
be
different
the
truth
is
it's
always
the
same.
Yes,
the
topic
may
be
different
or
the
circumstances,
but
when
all
said
and
done,
it
all
came
back
to
the
same
thing.
They
both
knew
it,
but
neither
has
the
courage
or
strength
to
address
the
underlying
issue.
So
they
continue
to
argue.
It
was
a
concerning
development
that
he
couldn't
get
out
of
his
mind.
He'd
had
many
friends
throughout
his
early
years
and
had
fond
memories
of
playing
with
them,
but
he
couldn't
understand
how
it
had
all
stopped.
There
was
some
point
as
he
grew
up
that
he
played
with
each
of
his
friends
for
the
very
last
time,
and
he
had
no
idea
that
it
would
be
the
last.
Then
came
the
night
of
the
first
falling
star.
It
was
seen
early
in
the
morning,
rushing
over
Winchester
eastward,
a
line
of
flame
high
in
the
atmosphere.
Hundreds
must
have
seen
it
and
taken
it
for
an
ordinary
falling
star.
It
seemed
that
it
fell
to
earth
about
one
hundred
miles
east
of
him.
Time
is
all
relative
based
on
age
and
experience.
When
you
are
a
child
an
hour
is
a
long
time
to
wait
but
a
very
short
time
when
that’s
all
the
time
you
are
allowed
on
your
iPad.
As
a
teenager
time
goes
faster
the
more
deadlines
you
have
and
the
more
you
procrastinate.
As
a
young
adult,
you
think
you
have
forever
to
live
and
don’t
appreciate
the
time
you
spend
with
others.
As
a
middle-aged
adult,
time
flies
by
as
you
watch
your
children
grow
up.
And
finally,
as
you
get
old
and
you
have
fewer
responsibilities
and
fewer
demands
on
you,
time
slows.
You
appreciate
each
day
and
are
thankful
you
are
alive.
An
hour
is
the
same
amount
of
time
for
everyone
yet
it
can
feel
so
different
in
how
it
goes
by.
Samantha
wanted
to
be
famous.
The
problem
was
that
she
had
never
considered
all
the
downsides
to
actually
being
famous.
Had
she
taken
the
time
to
objectively
consider
these
downsides,
she
would
have
never
agreed
to
publically
sing
that
first
song.
Hopes
and
dreams
were
dashed
that
day.
It
should
have
been
expected,
but
it
still
came
as
a
shock.
The
warning
signs
had
been
ignored
in
favor
of
the
possibility,
however
remote,
that
it
could
actually
happen.
That
possibility
had
grown
from
hope
to
an
undeniable
belief
it
must
be
destiny.
That
was
until
it
wasn't
and
the
hopes
and
dreams
came
crashing
down.
It
was
easy
to
spot
her.
All
you
needed
to
do
was
look
at
her
socks.
They
were
never
a
matching
pair.
One
would
be
green
while
the
other
would
be
blue.
One
would
reach
her
knee
while
the
other
barely
touched
her
ankle.
Every
other
part
of
her
was
perfect,
but
never
the
socks.
They
were
her
micro
act
of
rebellion.
Dave
wasn't
exactly
sure
how
he
had
ended
up
in
this
predicament.
He
ran
through
all
the
events
that
had
lead
to
this
current
situation
and
it
still
didn't
make
sense.
He
wanted
to
spend
some
time
to
try
and
make
sense
of
it
all,
but
he
had
higher
priorities
at
the
moment.
The
first
was
how
to
get
out
of
his
current
situation
of
being
naked
in
a
tree
with
snow
falling
all
around
and
no
way
for
him
to
get
down.
Dave
watched
as
the
forest
burned
up
on
the
hill,
only
a
few
miles
from
her
house.
The
car
had
been
hastily
packed
and
Marta
was
inside
trying
to
round
up
the
last
of
the
pets.
Dave
went
through
his
mental
list
of
the
most
important
papers
and
documents
that
they
couldn't
leave
behind.
He
scolded
himself
for
not
having
prepared
these
better
in
advance
and
hoped
that
he
had
remembered
everything
that
was
needed.
He
continued
to
wait
for
Marta
to
appear
with
the
pets,
but
she
still
was
nowhere
to
be
seen.
He
heard
the
loud
impact
before
he
ever
saw
the
result.
It
had
been
so
loud
that
it
had
actually
made
him
jump
back
in
his
seat.
As
soon
as
he
recovered
from
the
surprise,
he
saw
the
crack
in
the
windshield.
It
seemed
to
be
an
analogy
of
the
current
condition
of
his
life.
It
was
a
good
idea.
At
least,
they
all
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
at
the
time.
Hindsight
would
reveal
that
in
reality,
it
was
an
unbelievably
terrible
idea,
but
it
would
take
another
week
for
them
to
understand
that.
Right
now,
at
this
very
moment.
they
all
agreed
that
it
was
the
perfect
course
of
action
for
the
current
situation.
Josh
had
spent
year
and
year
accumulating
the
information.
He
knew
it
inside
out
and
if
there
was
ever
anyone
looking
for
an
expert
in
the
field,
Josh
would
be
the
one
to
call.
The
problem
was
that
there
was
nobody
interested
in
the
information
besides
him
and
he
knew
it.
Years
of
information
painstakingly
memorized
and
sorted
with
not
a
sole
giving
even
an
ounce
of
interest
in
the
topic.
He
dropped
the
ball.
While
most
people
would
think
that
this
was
a
metaphor
of
some
type,
in
Joe's
case
it
was
absolutely
literal.
He
had
hopes
of
reaching
the
Major
League
and
that
dream
was
now
it
great
jeopardy.
All
because
he
had
dropped
the
ball.
They
say
you
only
come
to
peace
with
yourself
when
you
know
yourself
better
than
those
around
you.
Derick
knew
nothing
about
this.
He
thought
he
had
found
peace
but
this
was
an
illusion
as
he
was
about
to
find
out
with
an
unexpected
occurrence
that
he
actually
knew
nothing
about
himself.
The
river
slowly
meandered
through
the
open
space.
It
had
hidden
secrets
that
it
didn't
want
to
reveal.
It
had
a
well-planned
strategy
to
appear
calm,
inviting,
and
appealing.
That's
how
the
river
lured
her
unknowing
victims
to
her
water's
edge.
You
can
decide
what
you
want
to
do
in
life,
but
I
suggest
doing
something
that
creates.
Something
that
leaves
a
tangible
thing
once
you're
done.
That
way
even
after
you're
gone,
you
will
still
live
on
in
the
things
you
created.
I
love
the
feel
of
wood
curls
flying
off
the
lathe
as
I
begin
to
shape
the
log
in
front
of
me.
The
sound
of
scraping
changes
based
on
the
wetness
of
the
wood,
the
speed
at
which
the
lathe
is
turning,
and
the
type
of
cut
I
am
making.
The
smell
and
feel
of
wet
wood
being
turned
are
unique.
The
water
is
sprayed
out
as
I
cut
through
the
different
layers
of
wood.
A
log
can
turn
into
anything
one's
imagination
can
think
of
with
the
right
set
of
hands-on
tools.
I
have
those
hands
and
imagination.
I
use
all
of
my
senses
and
intuition
to
create
a
beautiful
object.
That
is
why
I
enjoy
turning
wood.
It
wasn't
quite
yet
time
to
panic.
There
was
still
time
to
salvage
the
situation.
At
least
that
is
what
she
was
telling
himself.
The
reality
was
that
it
was
time
to
panic
and
there
wasn't
time
to
salvage
the
situation,
but
he
continued
to
delude
himself
into
believing
there
was.
